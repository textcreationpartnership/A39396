            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET it not ſeem ſtrange unto you, that being no Native of <hi>Waies,</hi> but born as far remote as <hi>Caer luid Coyd,</hi> I ſhould attempt to compile a General Hiſtory and entitle it <hi>The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern Brittiſh and Welſh Hiſtory.</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> wrote a Hiſtory of the whole World; Mr. <hi>Knolls</hi> compoſed the Tranſactions of the Turkiſh Empire; both Engliſh, both excellent and approved Authors: many more have done the like. The enduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which drew me on to attempt this work, were firſt the marriage of a perſon of quality of that Nation; Secondly my long continuance and aboad in that Country, which hath rendered me in a manner a Native; the civilities of the Gentry prick me forwards, and the help of a good Library of Sir <hi>Edward Morgans</hi> of <hi>Lantarnam,</hi> encouraged me to bring the <hi>Embrion</hi> to its full maturity: many and thoſe moſt learned, both Accademicks honoured with the ſcarlet robe; and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialiſts enobled with ſword and ſpurs, have added much luſtre to the almoſt periſht Brittiſh glory, unto whoſe writings I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelf highly engaged; from their Hives, I have ext acted many drams of hony, and laid it up in ſtore to preſent unto the VVorld in a whole Maſs, that many may undeceive themſelves, and rectifie there miſled judgments, who apprehend the thirteen Counties of <hi>Wales,</hi> to produce nothing but Barrenneſs: as for the language, if any ſeem to make a queſtion, this I ſuppoſe may give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto his curioſity: That, <hi>The beginning and original thereof as yet was never fully diſcovered:</hi> ſome dream that it was had from the Gallick as Neighbouring, others from the Romans as conquering, yet is it ſo far different from all the <hi>Europæan</hi> and VVeſtern tongues,
<pb facs="tcp:61256:6"/> (at leaſt as now they are) and hath ſo little affinity and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of them, that its improbable from them to have either extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or derivation: They I think do not judge amiſs, who affirm that amongſt the reſt, it received its firſt being at the confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> for it ſounds moſt after the Eaſtern way, having little or no congruence, or affinity with the VVeſt, unleſs ſome few words ſcattered and left by the ſubduing Roman, and ſo lately contracted and intermingled by the daily commerce of the Engliſh: ſome out of <hi>Cæſar</hi> will infer a conſequence that the <hi>Gallic</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage were the ſame, when he ſaith <hi>Gallis (in more poſitum) ut qui Druidum diſciplinam diligentius cognoſcere vellent, in adverſam Britanniam ad Druides proficiſcerentur, quod eis nihil profuiſſet niſi idem his cum illis fuiſſet ſermo, cum Druides libris non uterentur ſed omnia viva voce explicarent:</hi> but this ſignifies little to perſwade that the language of theſe two Nations was the ſame; for the language in which the <hi>Druides</hi> taught their myſteries, was that of Greece: <hi>Carmina multa millia interdum viginti annorum studio cogebantur e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcere, qui eorum diſciplinæ ſe tradidiſſent, quæ Græca fuiſſe non teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quis conjecerit:</hi> ſo that the inference is, that thoſe of <hi>Gallia,</hi> learned from the Brittiſh <hi>Druides,</hi> the uſe and ſpeech of the Greek tongue only. It is no ſufficient proofe to alledge that the continent was firſt inhabited, and that from thence the Iſlands took their language, for it is very probable, that ſome Iſlands as being the moſt ſafe and ſecureſt places, were even with the firſt inhabited. VVhich <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſeems to intimate concerning <hi>Brittain;</hi> and ſacred writ tells us, that the Iſlands towards the North were allotted to the off-ſpring of <hi>Japhet,</hi> amongſt which ſome learned Authors place <hi>Brittain:</hi> Thoſe who endeavour to make good that the <hi>Brittains</hi> borrowed their language from the Latines, let them ſtop their mouths with this; <hi>Priſca Italiæ lingua ſub priſcis Italiæ regibus quicunque fuerint uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pata, Doricæ ſimilis fuiſſe dicitur, ejuſque initio magna fuit ſtirilitas quæ a poetis Eunio, Plauto, Pacuvio, &amp; aliis, ab Hiſtiorographis &amp; maxime ab Oratoribus deterſa eſt, facta a vicinis mutuatione vel novis excogitatis vocibus.</hi> And again, <hi>ſed &amp; veteres Latini ſumma lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae inopia laborantes, tum ob aliorum populorum in jus civitatis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſorum linguis infinita ſumpſiſſe dicuntur, tum maxime a Græcis &amp; Etruſcis quos</hi> Aramæa <hi>vel Syriaca olim uſos credunt, &amp; voces Latinas quæ hodie habentur, non errarit ſi quis cenſeat eſſe Tuſcae originis.</hi> So that we ſee the Latines more fit to borrow, then to lend: ſome may ſay that many Brittiſh words, ſound Latin like, tis true, <hi>Eſt natura hominum novitatis avida.</hi> The Brittains call that <hi>Rhoud,</hi> which the Latines call <hi>Rota,</hi> in Engliſh a wheel, not that they wanted a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant word in their own language, for they have two, <hi>Troel</hi> and <hi>Olwyn,</hi> they call that <hi>Porth,</hi> which the Romans call <hi>Portam</hi> yet can they if they pleaſe call it as properly <hi>Moreb:</hi> As for their borrowing words from
<pb facs="tcp:61256:6"/> the Greeks, the like reaſon may be given: Moreover <hi>Bladud,</hi> when he went to <hi>Athens</hi> to apply himſelf to the ſtudy of Philoſophy, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, brought with him many learned <hi>Graecian</hi> Philoſophers, who being converſant with the <hi>Druides,</hi> communicating with them in points of doctrinalls, many greek words might become familiar with the <hi>Brittains.</hi> The moſt conſtant opinion is, that before the confuſion of <hi>Babel</hi> the Hebrew was the ſole and only language, and in that grand confuſion, the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> queſtionleſs was one, probably uſed in <hi>Phrigia</hi> where <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood, and from thence conveyed unto this our Iſland. There was a People in <hi>Italy,</hi> in thoſe places which we now call <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> called <hi>Brutii</hi> from the name of <hi>Brutus;</hi> whoſe nomenclation and language differed very little from that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Brittains:</hi> this people after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi> was brought into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Nestor,</hi> where the <hi>Pylians</hi> built a City called <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontus;</hi> the <hi>Brutii</hi> built another, naming it <hi>Nova Troja,</hi> after by the <hi>Tarentines</hi> call'd <hi>Heraclea.</hi> So our <hi>Brittains</hi> in this our Iſland built <hi>Troy Novant</hi> now <hi>London,</hi> both taking their name from <hi>Brutus,</hi> and both having the like affection to the memory of old <hi>Troy.</hi> As concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Brutus</hi> his coming hither, (having more at large ſpoken of it, in the enſuing Hiſtory) I will only here inſert this out of our own records.</p>
                  <p>In the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> I. at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where held a Parliament, after much diligent ſearch of Antiquities and due examination, as the greateſt matter of right of a Kingdom required: Apologitical letters were ſent to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſealed with an hundred ſeals and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes thus. <hi>Rex Angliae ex deliberato concilio apud Lincolniam convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato pro jure ſuo declarando, literam hujus tenoris reſcripſit centum ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillis ſignatam:</hi> wherein is declared and juſtified that in the time of <hi>Hely</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Brutus</hi> a <hi>Trojan</hi> landed here, and by his own name called the Country <hi>Britannia,</hi> before named <hi>Albion: De nomine ſuo Britanniam ſocioſque ſuos Britones appellavit:</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving three Sons, <hi>Locrinus Albanactus,</hi> and <hi>Camber,</hi> at his death devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iſland into three parts or provinces. <hi>Loegria</hi> now <hi>England,</hi> (though VVelſh keep the old name) was given to <hi>Locrinus</hi> the eldeſt Son; <hi>Albania Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Albanact</hi> the ſecond Son. <hi>Cambria,</hi> now miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Camber</hi> his third Son. <hi>Locrino primogenito dedit illam partem quæ quondam Loegria, nunc vero Anglia nominatur; Albanacto filio Secundo dedit Albaniam, quæ nunc Scotia Vocitatur; Cambrio vero tertio filio dedit Cambriam, quæ wallia appellatur, reſervata Locri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no regia dignitate;</hi> this conjecture may ſuffice for this buſineſs, it being teſtified by ſo many Domeſticall and forrain, private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick witneſſes, that this his tripartite diviſion was here from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, and the firſt name of <hi>Brittain</hi> given by <hi>Brutus.</hi> Other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things might have been added to this Hiſtory, as that of St. <hi>Winefreds</hi> well, and many more note worthy, which I leave to other pens, who happily may write the deſcriptions of each County in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
<pb facs="tcp:61256:7"/> as God willing, I do ſpeedily intend to publiſh that of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothſhire:</hi> had I been near the preſs to have peruſed every ſheet as it paſt, I would have affixed an Alphabetical index at the end of this work, of all memorable paſſages; but I intreat the courteous Reader to accept in good part my weak endeavours, and what Errata's he ſhall find not mended by the Printer, to daſh them lightly with his quill, and not impute them to me who deſire to be eſteemed by all.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61256:12"/> Fowl, Cattle and Corn, ſo plenteous that it ſupplieth theſe with other Countries in their want; Their Nobility and Gentry are very ſtudious of learning and all civil knowledge, for which end they not only frequent the three Univerſities of their own Kingdom (St. <hi>Andrews, Glaſco,</hi> and <hi>Edenborough,</hi> the Nurſeries of their Muſes, but alſo much addict themſelves to travel into Forraign Countries, eſpecially <hi>France;</hi> whoſe King hath a Guard of <hi>Scots,</hi> the double <hi>Treſhure florie</hi> in the Arms of the Kingdome, makes manifeſt the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt in former time in that Nation.

                        <p>
                           <hi>LOcrinus</hi> the firſt and eldeſt Son of the late deceaſed <hi>Brutus,</hi> takes poſſeſſion of his Kingdom of <hi>Loegria,</hi> now <hi>England,</hi> in the year from the Creation of the World, four thouſand fourſcore and ſeven. This Kingdome as it was the largeſt, ſo was it the moſt beautifull, rich and commodious, both in reſpect of Navigable Rivers, Ports and Havens; as alſo fruitfulneſs of the Soils, and abundance of ſtately Woods and Groves, and according to the relation and aſſertion of <hi>Policronica</hi> and <hi>Guido de Collumna,</hi> it ſtretched forth and extended it ſelf as far as to the River <hi>Humber,</hi> as now it is called, (a name when <hi>Locrinus</hi> entered into Soveraignty unknown.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Locrinus</hi> thus inveſted in his Principality, (as much as could be in a Land not formerly, or at leaſt by ſavage People or Gyants inhabited) made ready to his hand; His Brother with ſuch Regiments as were allotted to him to Colonize and people his Part, being retired into his own Quarters or Patrimony, whilſt by his own Induſtry and Advice of ſuch as he made uſe of in a matter of ſo great importance, was endeavouring to frame a modell how to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and Uphold this his new Plantation, an unexpected Enemy appears; <hi>Humber</hi> with a Navy arrives, and having with him a ſufficient Army of war-like <hi>Huns,</hi> ſets upon <hi>Albanact,</hi> whoſe thoughts were more buſied how to ſettle his People and frame his Commonwealth, then to oppoſe an Enemy; diſtreſſed <hi>Albanact</hi> is put to his ſhifts, whilſt the <hi>Scythian</hi> King, for ſo moſt ancient Writers onely call him, takes occaſion by the Foretop, and making uſe of his opportunity fiercely aſſaults the <hi>Albanian</hi> Prince, and with bloody ſlaughter, and the death of <hi>Albanact,</hi> makes way for himſelf and Followers to intrude into his Poſſeſſions, who as yet had ſcarce time to call them his own.</p>
                        <p>Fame whoſe vigilant eyes never ſleep, with an exaſperating Trumpet quickly blowes this unfortunate Newes into the Eares of <hi>Locrinus;</hi> he to revenge the Diſhonour done and the Death of his Brother, and alſo to enjoy that which now by right was fallen unto him; but above all to remove ſo dangerous and powerful a Neighbour, or rather Enemy, ſummons all his Nobles, and gathers together all the force he poſſibly could make; and with a mind full of Revenge, Reſolution, and Courage Advanceth, and with ſpeedy Marches ſetteth forwards to Fight the <hi>Scythian</hi> before he take to Deep root in <hi>Albania. Camber</hi> is not ſlow to ſecond this action as a thing which he conceives deeply to concern himſelf; and therefore unites his Forces with his Brothers that thereby the Victory may be more certaine, and the loſſe leſſe conſiderable. Deſire quickens actions, and reſolute ſouls ſeem rather to flye then walk; The Armies meet, the <hi>Brittains</hi> inflamed with revenge for the Death of <hi>Albanact,</hi> who was their fellow Souldier and Traveller, Son of their Deceaſed King, brother to the preſent, breath nothing but Death and Confuſion. The <hi>Scythian</hi> with like Valour and Courage, thinks no danger too great to make good by the ſword what he already purchaſt and gotten by the ſame. Terrible is the conflict on both ſides, but fortune after long debate, with victory Crowns the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> the <hi>Scythians</hi> are put to Flight, and flying are ſo hotly purſued, that many are drowned and the King himſelf, (and as the Poet ſaith of <hi>Icarus, Icarus Icarias, nomine fecit aquas</hi>) put to ſuch a ſtraite that he was Drowned in that Famous River which from his name hath ever ſince been called <hi>Humber,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eſt certe totius Britanniae aeſtuarium ampliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum &amp; piſcoſiſſimum</hi> the largeſt and moſt full of Fiſh throughout <hi>Britannie.

                        <p>For as whereas King <hi>Roderick</hi> had ſent a Kinſman of his own called <hi>Count Julian</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor into <hi>Africk,</hi> and in the mean time Raviſhed his Daughter, or (as ſome write) his Wife; the Count underſtanding it at his return, was ſo incenſed therewith againſt the King, that for revenge thereof he practiſed with the <hi>Moores</hi> to bring them into <hi>Spain,</hi> who with his aſſiſtance Conquered it ſo ſpeedily, and with ſuch deſtruction of the people, that the puniſhment of God was moſt evident therein: for having firſt overthrown King <hi>Roderick</hi> (whoſe body could never after the battel be found) they ſubdued almoſt all <hi>Spain</hi> in Eight months or in Fourteen as ſome ſay, and ſlew 700000. of all ſorts of people, beſides great numbers of Captives which they ſent priſoners into <hi>Barbary:</hi> and from that time forwards they remained in the poſſeſſion of that Kingdome or in ſome great part thereof for the ſpace of 700 years.</p>
                        <p>This example of the Conqueſt and ſubverſion of <hi>Spain</hi> for the ſins of the fleſh, was ſo famous and ſo much obſerved by Godly and Wiſe men, at the ſame time when it hapned that <hi>St. Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius</hi> a Countryman of ours and Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Cermany,</hi> who lived in the ſame age and converted the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Friſons</hi> from <hi>Paganiſme</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, propoſed it to one called <hi>Etholbud</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians</hi> to withdraw him from his diſſolute life, and tells him that in old <hi>Saxony</hi> where there was no Chriſtianity, there if either Maid or Wife did commit Adultery or Fornication, ſhe was firſt ſtrangled and after burnt: and he that corrupted her, Hanged over her, or elſe ſhe was ſtripped naked to the middle and whipped by chaſt Matrons from Town to Town, and prickt with ſharp Knives till ſhee dyed therewith.</p>

CCC. XXXiii. This King was of a moſt Noble and Heroick mind, as being queſtionleſſe bred under the Diſcipline of thoſe Philoſophers which his Father had brought from <hi>Athens,</hi> beſides a natural Propenſion of his own to moral Vertue; inſomuch that his Kingdom flouriſhed in great Peace and abundance of Wealth.</p>
                        <p>This King to imitate his worthy Predeceſſors, laid the Foundation of a Famous city, calling it after his own Name <hi>Caerlirion,</hi> and after <hi>Leirceſter:</hi> this is one of thoſe 28 cities where Flamens were. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us that it was called <hi>Ligeceſtria, Leogora, Legeoceſter</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> ſaying it rather ſavoured of Antiquity then handſomeneſſe; yet acknowledeth that it was formerly a biſhoprick, but that the See being removed, it much decayed in renown, till at laſt <hi>Edelfleda optima Foemina</hi> the beſt of Women or a very good woman in the year 913. did repair it, and incloſe it with new Walls; inſomuch that <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> in his leſſer Hiſtory ſaith, Legeceſtria <hi>

                        <p>King <hi>Leir</hi> beginning now to be aged and full of years, having no Heir-male, he called unto him his three Daughters, <hi>Gonorilla, Ragan</hi> and <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> intending out of the diſcovery of their love and filial affection and duty towards Him to ſettle his Kingdome upon them: to the Eldeſt he ſaid, Daughter, I ſhall deſire you to expreſſe unto me, how well and dearly you love and eſteem me your aged Father; the young Lady hearing a queſtion of ſo high a nature and ſo much concerning propoſed unto Her, Firſt that her anſwer may not ſeem forged or to have any ſmack or relliſh of diſſimulation, calls the immortal Gods (being then the cuſtome amongſt Pagans) and all the celeſtial Powers to witneſſe her Aſſertion, and then replies; My Princely Lord and Father, I love you more then my own ſoul: the feeble old man was much taken with this Anſwer, reſting ſatisfied, that his Daughter did cordially and entirely love him: He calls for the ſecond, propounds the ſame queſtion; ſhe thinking to out-vie her El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſiſter, and thereby to endear and engratiate her ſelf into the old Mans favour, ſpares no oaths or invocations and imprecations, aſſuring him that her Tongue was too ſlender a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to deliver the depth of her affection and duty, and that ſhe loved him far beyond all creatures; <hi>Leir</hi> is tickled and exceedingly ſolaced with theſe two Anſwers and thinks no mortal Man more happy in his children then himſelf. <hi>Cordeilla</hi> is called for, the ſame interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory uſed; ſhe wittily perceiving the deep diſſimulation and fawning of her Siſters, replies; My deareſt Father, I am much joyed to ſee you ſo well pleaſed with the expreſſive Anſwers of my two ſiſters; for my own part as a Father I have ever honoured, obeyed and loved you, and for ever ſhall and if you deſire further expreſſion from me, Know honoured Sir, That as much as you deſerve to be beloved ſo much I love you and no more.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>LEIR</hi> being nothing pleaſed with the integrity of his third Daughters anſwer, <hi>Obſequium amicos veritas Odium parit;</hi> bethinks himſelf how he may beſt diſpoſe and beſtow his two eldeſt Daughters to their moſt content, honour and advancement, the Eldeſt therefore he eſpouſeth to the Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the ſecond to the Duke of <hi>Albania,</hi> which is now called <hi>Scotland,</hi> dividing his Kingdom betwixt them in Reverſion, and a Moiety for their preſent maintenance and livelyhood, nothing being left for the poor Lady <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> whoſe tongue was the true Embaſſador of her heart, and whoſe heart hated all diſſimulation and hypocriſie.</p>
                        <p>Fame who is never ſlow in reporting the tranſactions of eminent perſons eſpecially Kings, ſounds this paſſage of King <hi>Leir</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and with a ſhrill Note ecchoes forth, the beauty, modeſty, vertue, and all the adorning graces which wait upon <hi>Cordeilla. Aganippus</hi> (an eminent perſonage and by ſome ſtiled King of <hi>France,</hi> through a great miſtake; for as <hi>Policro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon, Petrus Pictanienſis, Robert Gagwine, Antonius Epiſcopus,</hi> and divers others affirm the name of <hi>France</hi> was not then known, neither were there any Kings, the inhabitants being called <hi>Galli</hi> and Tributaries to the Romans, and ſo continued till the time of <hi>Valentinianus</hi> the Emperor,) hearing <hi>Cordeilla</hi>'s beauty ſo highly extolled, her vertue ſo ſuperlatively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, deems her a fit companion for his Princely bed and fortunes, if ſo rare a Jewel may be purchaſed: Upon a mature reſolution he ſends his Agents to the court of King <hi>Leir</hi> with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61256:19"/> full inſtructions to demand <hi>Cordeilla</hi> in Marriage: The offerd Fortune pleaſeth the King, yet he fears the ſucceſs; by reaſon of his own folly which had given all to the two ſiſters, and left nothing for the third: <hi>Leir</hi> returns thanks to <hi>Aganippus</hi> by his Embaſſadors, ſhews a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to comply with their Maſters requeſt; and withall lays open his unſufficiency to beſtow any Dowry upon her; <hi>Aganippus</hi> enformed by Letters of theſe paſſages, is glad his ſuit and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion finds friendly acceptance, and far valuing the rich endowments of his ſo much affected <hi>Cordeilla</hi> before all terrene riches ſo he enjoy the beloved treaſure of his heart, deſires no more: the eſpouſals are with all ſolemnity celebrated, and <hi>Cordeilla</hi> anſwerable to the greatneſs of her birth and quality, conveyed to <hi>Aganippus,</hi> who (by the opinion of thoſe who write that <hi>France</hi> was then governed by twelve Kings) was one, and ſo <hi>Cordeilla</hi> a Queen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Leir</hi> having thus happily as might be thought, diſpoſed of his three daughters; being aged, betakes himſelf to eaſe and quietneſs, and ſo intends to ſpin out the remnant of his time, but his Sons in Law <hi>Monaghlanus</hi> and <hi>Henninus</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> envy the happy tranquility of the feeble old King; and each daughter, for all their deep and large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of filial love and duty, <hi>Patris inquirit in annos: Leir</hi> lives too long, too much at eaſe, his bones would better become a Sepulchre, then a Throne; and ſince the fatal Siſters will not of their own accord cut off his thred of life, his daughters by the hands of their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and covetous husbands will undertake that task: nothing is now heard in <hi>Brittaine</hi> but the claſhing of arms, neighing of horſes, thundering of Trumpets, and warlike Muſick. The impotent King is begirt on all ſides with Martial Troops, and not able to reſiſt two ſuch powerfull enemies, to preſerve that ſmall ſpan of life, is forced to flie for ſuccour, being quite forlorn, to his daughter <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> whom formerly he had ſo much ſlighted; The arrival of the Father is not long unknown to the daughter, who acquaints her husband with ſo ſad an accident; <hi>Aganippus</hi> out of an heroick ſpirit, compaſſionating the calamity of a diſtreſſed Prince, eſpecially his wives Father, puts on a reſolution to chaſtiſe and revenge ſo groſs an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and to reinveſt him in his throne again. <hi>Cordeilla</hi> is not idle in the mean time, but with all obſequious behaviour like a dutifull childe cheriſheth her drooping Father, accomodates him with all Princely proviſion, with pleaſant ſpeeches drives away his melancholy thoughts, and leaves nothing undone or ſaid, which may add vigour and alacrity to his pierced heart: <hi>Aganippus</hi> arrives in <hi>Brittain</hi> with his Father in Law, gives battel to the diſobedient Rebels, gives them the overthrow, and again eſtabliſheth <hi>Leir</hi> in his Regal dignity; but the Author of ſo great happineſs lived not long after, leaving <hi>Cordeilla</hi> a ſad and diſconſolate widow.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Leir</hi> once more holding and guiding the ſtern of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Monarchy, paſſed his time with perfect quietneſs, the ſpace of three years; after which time he left this tranſitory world, leaving his daughter <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> as well ſhe deſerved, to ſucceed him in his Kingdom; his body was buried at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in a Vault under the River ſide,<note place="margin">John Rous <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud</hi> Hows <hi>in</hi> Stow.</note> which he himſelf had built and conſecrated to <hi>Janus Bifrons,</hi> where the workmen of the Town, when the ſolemnity of the day came, began all things which they had to do the year following.</p>

                        <p>We finde, ſaith my Author, in ſeveral Authors and Antiquaries, to ſpeak in their words, that 800. years before the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Cunedagius, King of all</hi> Brittain,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Broughton,</hi> fol. 336. 6.</note>

In the third or fourth Book of <hi>Policronicon,</hi> there are other conceits and judgements ſhewed concerning calculation of theſe years; whereof (ſaith <hi>Fabian</hi>) the moſt certain is five thouſand, and two hundred years; there are not wanting others, whereof ſome reckon ſome more, ſome leſs: ſome account from the firſt building and ſtructure of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſome from the overthrow and ſubverſion of the moſt famous City of <hi>Troy,</hi> others from the founding of <hi>Troynovant</hi> or <hi>London;</hi> and not a few from divers Edifices and Foundations.

                        <p>Whilſt <hi>Belinus</hi> thus imployed his time in providing for his Countrey and Subjects neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conveniences, <hi>Brennus</hi> after his late and almoſt irrecoverable overthrow, like a forlorne Pilgrime ſpends his time in <hi>Gallia,</hi> and there ſummons all his wits to Counſel how he may in ſome ſort recover his Countrey and former Glory and Renown; and as great ſpirits will leave nothing unattempted to bring their deſignes to the wiſhed period; ſo he reſolves being accompanied only by twelve Cavaliers to addreſſe himſelf unto a Duke who had great power and command in thoſe parts: where it is to be obſerved by the way that (as <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tropius</hi> and other writers affirm) the <hi>Galli</hi> at that time poſſeſſed divers Counries; upon which ground <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Lavius</hi> who writ the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> tells us that thoſe Souldiers who followed <hi>Brennus</hi> when he ſacked <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>Galli Senonenſes,</hi> to wit, thoſe who inhabited the Countrey where the City <hi>Sena</hi> ſtood and yet doth, (as teſtifyeth the Author of <hi>Cronica Cronicorum</hi> and others) in a part of <hi>Italie,</hi> in ſucceeding ages known by the name <hi>Etruria;</hi> which <hi>Sena,</hi> as divers affirm was built by <hi>Brennus</hi> when he there inhabited, before the Incarnation of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, iii. C. lxxx. and vi. years.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Brennus</hi> finding favourable admittance into the Court of Duke of <hi>Seginus</hi> of <hi>Allobroge</hi> (for ſo <hi>Gaufride</hi> calls him) which after was called <hi>Armorica,</hi> and now little <hi>Brittaine</hi> according to <hi>Policronicon</hi> and the Engliſh Chronicle; the Duke beholding the comely perſon, manly proportion, and princely carriage and behaviour of <hi>Brennus,</hi> and much condoling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating the calamity of his Fortunes, which he with a ſingular grace had declared, (ſet out in the moſt lively colours and flowers of Eloquence,) entertained him in a moſt friendly manner, and obſerving that he delighted and was moſt expert in hunting and hawking, and was fully accompliſht with all the parts belonging to a Gentleman, caſt ſuch favours upon him, that in ſhort time he became the moſt eminent man in the Court, and the only favorite of the Duke; inſomuch that <hi>Seginus</hi> being in admiration of his endowments, and gallant behaviour, reſolves to make him his Son in law; with this promiſe alſo, that if the Gods ſhall call for him hence without other Heir, that then the iſſue of <hi>Brennus</hi> ſhould ſucceed in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; or at leaſt, in caſe the Duke ſhould be made happy by the birth of a Son, that then he would uſe all poſſible endeavours to reeſtabliſh <hi>Brennus</hi> in his own Poſſeſſions, and upon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61256:25"/> theſe Conditions and Articles the Duke eſpouſeth his only Daughter and Heir to this Heroick <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Prince: theſe Nuptials are no wayes diſpleaſing to the Nobles of <hi>Allobroge,</hi> they all jointly giving their approbation and full conſent. Not long after, death ſummons <hi>Seginus</hi> to appear before a greater Tribunal then his own, and a convenient ſpace being allowed to the Dutcheſſe Dowager, the term whereof expired, ſhe was found not to have conceived nor to be with child; all ſorts did Homage to <hi>Brennus</hi> as their lawful Leige and Supreme. <hi>Brennus</hi> being not only a titular Prince, but poſſeſſed of large Territories; and finding great plenty of Treaſure congeſted by his wary and careful Predeceſſours, was not cloſe-fiſted, but with a liberal hand imparts a large Proportion to men of Action and gallant Reſolution, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines once more to hazard both life and fortunes with his Brother, rather then loſe <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> The ſons of <hi>Mars</hi> and fierce youthful ſpirits, applaud their Princes gallant Reſolution, and each equipps himſelf to the rank of his birth and height of his deſire. <hi>Bellinus</hi> hearing of theſe great and warlike Preparations like a prudent Prince, perceives this threatning cloud to bend its courſe towards <hi>Brittany;</hi> and therefore ſeeing he cannot prevent the coming thereof, makes ſuch proviſion that whereſoever it ſhall diſgorge it ſelf, it may do as ſlender hurt as may be; thus he ſtands in a readineſſe with Weapons to receive this menacing ſtorm with the point of his Sword. <hi>Brennus</hi> maugre all oppoſitions arrives with his Navy: Theſe heavy tidings pierce the very ſoul of <hi>Connuvenna</hi> or <hi>Conwenna</hi> the poor afflicted Mother, whoſe affectionate love was equally divided betwixt her deareſt children; and having long time been deprived of the tender imbracements of her younger Son, carried with the moſt Noble paſſion of love, ſhe caſts her ſelf betwixt the Brothers, and with moſt bitter ſighes and floods of tears ſhews thoſe breſts which once they both had ſuckt; ſhe pleads, commands, intreats, nay begs to make them friends. An ancient Poet in few Verſes makes <hi>Conwenna</hi> to ſpeak thus:

It is ſaid that the firſt man that did bring wine to them, and did procure them to paſſe into <hi>Italy</hi> was a Noble man of <hi>Thuſcany</hi> called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and otherwiſe of no ill diſpoſed Nature; how be it he was ſubject to this misfortune fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61256:26"/> He was Tutor to an Orphan Child, the richeſt that was in that time in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and of complexion wondrous fair, he was called <hi>Lucumo.</hi> This Orphan was brought up in <hi>Arrons</hi> houſe of a Child, and though he was grown to ſtate, yet he would not depart from him feigning he was well and to his liking: but indeed the cauſe was that he loved his Miſtreſs, (<hi>Arrons</hi> wife whom ſecretly he had enjoyed a long time, and ſhe him) that made him like his continuance there. Howbeit in the end love having ſo poſſeſſed them both, that neither party could withdraw from other much leſſe conceale it, The young man ſtole her away by force from him, and ſo kept her; <hi>Arron</hi> put the matter in ſuite but he prevailed not, for <hi>Lucumo</hi> over-weighed him with Friends, Money, Gifts and Charges: which he took ſo grievouſly that he left his Countrey and having heard talk of the Gauls he went unto them and was their guide to bring them unto <hi>Italy.</hi> So they conquered at their firſt coming all that Countrey which the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> held in old time, beginning at the foot of the mountains, and ſtretched out in length from one Sea to the other, which invironeth <hi>Italy</hi> as the names themſelves do witneſs: for they call yet that Sea which looketh unto the North the Adriatick Sea, by reaſon of a City built ſome time by the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> which was called <hi>Adria:</hi> The other which lieth directly over againſt the South is called the <hi>Tuſcane</hi> Sea; all that Country is well planted with trees, and hath goodly pleaſant paſtures for beaſts, and cattel to feed in, and is notably watered with goodly running Rivers. There was alſo at that time, eighteen fair great Cities, all of them very ſtrong and well ſeated, as well to inrich the Inhabitants by Traffick, as to make them live delicately for pleaſure: All theſe Cities the <hi>Gauls</hi> had won, and had expulſed the <hi>Tuſcans;</hi> but this was done long before time. Now the <hi>Gauls</hi> being entred further into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> did beſiege the City of <hi>Cluſium,</hi> thereupon the <hi>Cluſians</hi> ſeeking ayd of the <hi>Romans,</hi> beſought them they would ſend Letters and Ambaſſadors unto thoſe barbarous people in their behalf. They ſent unto them three of the beſt and moſt honourable perſons of the City, all three of the houſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians. The <hi>Gauls</hi> received them very courteouſly becauſe of the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> and leaving to aſſault the City,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Brennus</hi> a <hi>Brittain</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                           </note> they gave them audience. The <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſadors did ask them what injury the <hi>Cluſians</hi> had done unto them, that they came to make Wars with them; <hi>Brennus</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls</hi> hearing this queſtion, ſmiled, and anſwered them thus, The <hi>Cluſians</hi> do us wrong in this; they being but few people together, and not able to occupy much Land, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding poſſeſs much, and will let us have no part with them that are ſtrangers, and out of our Country, and ſtand in need of ſeat and habitation; the like wrong was offered unto you <hi>Romans</hi> in old time by thoſe of <hi>Alba,</hi> by the <hi>Fidenates</hi> and <hi>Ardeates,</hi> and the <hi>Volſci,</hi> againſt whom ye have taken, and do take Arms at all times, and as oft as they will let you have no part of their goods, ye impriſon their perſons, rob, and ſpoil their goods, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Cities; and in doing this you do them no wrong at all, but follow the oldeſt Law that is in the world, which ever leaveth unto the ſtronger, that which the weaker cannot keep nor enjoy, beginning with the gods, and ending with beaſts; the which have this property in nature, that the bigger and ſtronger have ever the advantage of the weaker and leſſer; therefore leave your pitty to ſee theſe <hi>Cluſians</hi> beſieged, leſt you teach us <hi>Gauls</hi> to take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo of thoſe you have oppreſſed.</p>
                        <p>By this anſwer the <hi>Romans</hi> knew very well there was no way to make peace with King <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> wherefore they entered into the City of <hi>Cluſium,</hi> and incouraged the Inhabitants to ſally out with them upon theſe barbarous people, either becauſe they had a deſire to prove the valiantneſs of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or elſe to ſhew their own manhood and valour: ſo the Citizens went out and skirmiſhed with them, hard by the wals, in which one of the <hi>Fabians,</hi> called <hi>Quintus Fabius Ambuſtus,</hi> being excellently well horſed, and putting ſpurs to him, did ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a goodly big perſonage of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> that had advanced himſelf far before all the Troop of his Companions; he was not known at the firſt encounter, as well for the ſudden meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and skirmiſhing together; as for that his gliſtering armour dimmed the eyes of the enemies. But after he had ſlain the <hi>Gaul,</hi> and came to ſtrip him. <hi>Brennus</hi> then knew him, and proteſted againſt him,<note place="margin">

Hereupon <hi>Brennus</hi> forthwith left skirmiſhing, and raiſing the Siege from <hi>Cluſium,</hi> marched with his Army to <hi>Rome</hi> gates. And to the end that the <hi>Romans</hi> might know that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were not well pleaſed for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they had received; to have an honeſt colour to begin war with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſent an Herald before to <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand livery of the man that had offended him, that he might puniſh him accordingly. In the mean while he himſelf came marching after, by ſmall journeys, to receive their anſwer. The Senate hereupon aſſembled, and many of the Senators blamed the raſhneſs of the <hi>Fabians,</hi> but moſt of all the Prieſts, called the<note n="*" place="margin">Heralds very ancient.</note> 
                           <hi>Faeciales;</hi> for they followed it very cloſely, as a matter that concerned Religion, and the honour of the Gods, declaring, how the Senate in diſcharge of all the reſidue of the City for the offence committed, ſhould lay the whole weight and burden of it upon him alone, that only had done the Fact. (<hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the wiſeſt and moſt peaceable of all the Kings of <hi>Rome</hi> that had been, was he that erected the Colledge of thoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Heralds.</note> 
                           <hi>Faeciales,</hi> and did ordain that they ſhould be Keepers of Peace, and Judges to hear and allow all the cauſes for the which they ſhould juſtly begin any War) Nevertheleſs the Senate in the end turned over the ordering of the whole matter to the Will and Judgement of the people, before whom alſo the <hi>Faeciales,</hi> or Heralds did accuſe <hi>Fabius
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61256:26"/> Ambuſtus:</hi> The people made ſo little account of their propounded Religion, and honour of the Gods in that caſe, that inſtead of delivering this <hi>Fabius</hi> to the enemy, they did chooſe him for one of the Tribunes of the Souldiers with his brothers. The <hi>Gauls</hi> underſtanding this, were ſo furious and angry thereat, that they would no longer linger their journeys, but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with all ſpeed to <hi>Rome.</hi> The people that dwelt by the High-wayes where they ſhould paſſe by, were marvellouſly afraid to ſee the multitude of them and their brave and gallant Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; beginning to doubt the fury of their rage, they imagined that firſt of all they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Champion Countrey before them, and afterwards would take the ſtrong Cities. They contrariwiſe did take nothing at all out of the Fields, neither did any hurt or diſpleaſure unto any body; but paſſing by their Cities, cryed out, They went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and would have no Wars but with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and how otherwiſe they deſired to be friends with all the world. Theſe barbarous people march on in this wiſe towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the Tribunes of the Souldiers brought their Army to the Field to encounter them: they were no leſſe in number then the <hi>Gauls;</hi> for they were 40000 Foot men; howbeit moſt part of them were raw ſouldiers that had never ſerved in the Wars before. They were very careleſſe of their Gods, and diſſolute in matters of Religion; for they paſſed neither for good ſignes in their Sacrifices, neither to ask councel of their Soothſayers, which the <hi>Romans</hi> were religiouſly wont to doe before they gave any battel. To make the matter worſe; the number of the Captains, having Power and Authority alike, did as much (or more then the reſt) diſorder and confound their doings; for oft-times before, in far leſſe Matters and Dangers then theſe,<note place="margin">One Supreme better then Many.</note> they did uſe to chooſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Officers that had ſole and ſoveraign Authority, which they called Dictators; knowing very well of how great importance it is in dangerous times to have but one Head and General to command all, to have ſupreme Authority of juſtice in his hands,<note place="margin">Monarchy.</note> and not to be bound to deliver account of his doings to any. The injury alſo which they had too ungratefully done to <hi>Camillus,</hi> brought great miſchief then and inconvenience upon them; for the Captains after him durſt no more command the people roughly, but ever after did flatter them much. When their Armies were now brought into the Field, they Encamped themſelves by a little River called <hi>Allia,</hi> about the eleventh ſtone from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not far from the place where the ſame River falleth into <hi>Tiber;</hi> thither came <hi>Brennus</hi> with his Army to them, who overthrew them in battel by their diſorder and lack of Government: For the left point or wing of their battel was broken off at the firſt by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who charged them ſo furiouſly that they drave them headlong into the River. The right wing then retiring out of the plain before they had any Charge given, and having gotten certain Hills hard by them, they had little hurt, and moſt of them did recover <hi>Rome</hi> again; the reſt that eſcaped after the Enemies were weary of killing, fled by night unto the City of <hi>Veies,</hi> thinking <hi>Rome</hi> had been loſt, and all the City put to the Sword: this overthrow was on the longeſt day in Summer, the Moon being at the Full. The <hi>Romans</hi> were very ſuperſtitious in dayes Fortunate and Unfortunate, which I here paſſe over as not material to our buſineſſe in hand.</p>
                        <p>The day of this overthrow is one of thoſe which the <hi>Romans</hi> take for one of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateſt dayes that ever came unto them. Now after the battel loſt, if the <hi>Gauls</hi> had hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the chaſe of their flying enemies, nothing could have ſaved <hi>Rome</hi> from being Taken, and the Inhabitants thereof from being put unto the Sword; for the <hi>Romans</hi> that fled from the battel brought ſuch a fear upon thoſe that received them, and filled the whole City of <hi>Rome</hi> with ſuch grief and trembling that they wiſt not what to doe. The <hi>Gauls</hi> again believing lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Victory was ſo great as it was, fell to make good cheer for ſo great a joy received, and divided among them the ſpoil of their Enemies goods they found in the Camp. So gave they time and leiſure by this means to the multitude of people that fled out of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeek them ſome place of ſafety, and to ſuch as remain ſtill they left good hope to ſave themſelves and to make ſome proviſion for defence.</p>
                        <p>Thereupon they all fortified themſelves within <hi>Mont Capitol,</hi> and ſtoring it with all kind of Victuals, Armour, and Ammunition they wholy did forſake the reſt of the City; but the firſt work they took in hand was this, they did bring into their ſaid Fort, part of their ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and the profeſſed Veſtals brought thither all their holy Fire, and all their holy Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Furthermore the Prieſts of other Gods, and the moſt honourable old men of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> (that had been Conſulls aforetime or had paſt the honor of triumph) had not the heart to forſake <hi>Rome;</hi> but putting on all their coſtly Robes and Veſtments did vow and moſt willingly ſacrifice themſelves unto the fortune that ſhould befall them for the ſafety of their Countrey. And uſing certain words and prayers which their high Biſhop <hi>Fabius</hi> had taught them, they went even thus apparelled unto the great market place, and did ſit them down there in Chaires of <hi>Ivory,</hi> expecting the good will and pleaſure of the Gods what ſhould become of them. Within three dayes after <hi>Brennus</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> with his Army, who finding the Gates of the City all open, and the Walls without watch, he doubted ſome deviſe in it, and feared ſome privy ambuſh had been layed, as one hardly, believing to have found the <hi>Romans</hi> of ſo baſe a mind as to forſake their City. After being informed of the truth, he entred into <hi>Rome</hi> by the gate <hi>Collina,</hi> and took the ſame: little more then 360 years after it was firſt builded, if it be true at the leaſt that there remained any certaine Chronicles of thoſe times unto this preſent day; conſidering the trouble and confuſion of that time hath made many things more certaine then that, doubtful unto us; but ſo it was that the rumor ran to

                           <hi>Greece</hi> incontinently how <hi>Rome</hi> was taken, but yet withal ſomewhat doubtfully and uncertain; but <hi>Brennus</hi> having now entred <hi>Rome</hi> did appoint part of his ſouldiers to beſiege thoſe that were gotten in <hi>Mont Capitol,</hi> and he with the reſidue of his Army marched on towards the market-place, where when he ſaw the ancient Senators ſit gravely on their Chaires and ſpeak never a word, nor offered once to riſe, though they ſaw their enemies come Armed againſt them, neither changed countenance nor colour at all, but leaned ſoftly upon their ſtaves which they had in their hands ſeeming to be nothing affraid nor abaſhed, but looked one upon another; he wondered marvailouſly at it; this their ſo ſtrange manner at the firſt did ſo dump the <hi>Gauls</hi> that for a ſpace they ſtood ſtill, and were in doubt to come near to touch them, fearing leaſt they had been ſome Gods; until ſuch time as one of them went boldly to <hi>Marcus Papirius</hi> and laid his hand fair and ſoftly upon his long Beard,<note place="margin">The Majeſty of the old Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſet in the Market place of <hi>Rome.</hi>

For this cauſe they raſed the whole City and put all to the Sword that came into their hands, young and old, man, woman and child. Now this Siege continuing long and the <hi>Romans</hi> holding them out very ſtoutly, victuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow very ſcant in the Camp of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> inſomuch as they were driven on force to ſeek it abroad without the City; Hereupon they divided themſelves, whereof ſome remained ſtill with them at the Siege of the <hi>Capitol</hi> and the reſt went a foraging and ſpoiling all the Champion Country and Villages there abouts, ſcattered as it were by Bands and Companies, ſome here, ſome there, fearing nothing, nor paſſing upon watch or ward, they lived in ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Victory. Howbeit the greateſt Company amongſt them, went by fortune to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City of <hi>Ardea</hi> where <hi>Camillus</hi> dwelt living like a private man medling with no matters of State from the time of his Exile, until that preſent: But then he began not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think himſelf as a man that was in ſafety and might have eſcaped the hands of his enemies, but rather ſought how to deviſe and find all the means he could to ſubdue them if occaſion were ſo offered: whereupon conſidering that the Citizens of <hi>Ardea</hi> were enough in number to ſet upon them, though faint-hearted and cowardly by reaſon of the ſloth and negligence of the Governours and Captains who had no manner of experience in wars, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to caſt out theſe words among the young men. That they ſhould not think the <hi>Romans</hi> misfortune fell upon them through the Valour of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> nor that their Calamity (who had refuſed good Councel) had hapned unto them by any work or act of the <hi>Gauls</hi> having done nothing for their part to make them carry away the Victory, but that they ſhould think it was no other thing but fortune alone, who would needs ſhew her power. Therefore it were now a notable and honourable Enterprize (although ſomewhat dangerous) to drive thoſe ſtrangers out of their Country, conſidering that the onely end of their Victory was but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and conſume as fire all that fell into their hands; wherefore if they would but onely take a good luſty heart and courage, he would with opportunity and place aſſure them the Victory without danger. The young men were pleaſed with theſe words of life and comfort; whereupon <hi>Camillus</hi> went to break the matter alſo unto the Magiſtrates and Counſellours, and having drawn them by perſwaſions unto this Enterprize,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Now after the <hi>Gauls</hi> had run over the Champian Country, and were loaden with all ſorts of ſpoils, they did encamp themſelves negligently in open fields, and never charged Watch nor Ward; but having their full Carriage of Wine, laid them down to ſleep, and made no noiſe at all in their Camp.<note place="margin">Camill.</note> 
                           <hi>Camillus</hi> being advertized thereof by his ſeveral Scouts, cauſed the <hi>Ardeans,</hi> with as little noiſe, as might be, forthwith to go out into the fields, and having mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſomewhat roundly the diſtance between the City and the Camp of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> they came thither much about midnight: Then he made his Souldiers make great ſhouts and cries, and the Trumpets to be ſounded on every ſide to put a fear in their enemies, who yet with all the loud noiſe they made, could hardly be made to wake, they were ſo deadly drunk; yet there were ſome notwithſtanding, that for fear to be taken tardy, did buſtle up at this ſudden noiſe, and coming to themſelves fell to their weapons to reſiſt <hi>Camillus,</hi> which were ſlain by and by: the reſt, and the greateſt number of them, lay here and there ſcattered in the middle of the field, without any weapon, dead aſleep, ſtark drunk with wine, and were put to the ſword, and never ſtruck ſtroke; thoſe that fled out of the Camp that night (which were but few in numher) were overthrown alſo next day by the horſemen, which followed, and killed them as they took them ſtraggling here and there in the Field.

But he made anſwer, he would in no caſe conſent unto it, unleſs they that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in the Capitol had lawfully firſt confirmed it by their voices; for thoſe, ſaid he, as long as they do remain within the City, repreſent the State and body thereof; therefore if they commanded him to take this charge upon him, he would moſt willingly obey them; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they miſliked of it, that then he would not meddle againſt their good wills and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Howbeit there was one <hi>Pontius Cominius,</hi> among the young men (a man of a mean houſe, but yet deſirous of honour and glory) that offered himſelf very willingly to venter to get in, if he could, ſo he took no Letters to convey with him to them that were beſieged; for fear leſt they might be intercepted, and ſo they ſhould diſcover <hi>Camillus</hi> intention, but putting on an ill favoured gown upon him, he conveyed certain pieces of Cork under it, and travelling at noon days, kept on his way without fear, untill he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> bringing dark night with him; and becauſe he could not paſs by the bridge, for that the <hi>Gauls</hi> kept watch upon it, he wrapped ſuch cloaths, as he had, about his neck (which were not many nor heavy) and took the River, and ſwimming with theſe Corks which he had brought, at length he got over to the other ſide, where the City ſtood; then taking up thoſe lanes where he thought the enemies were not, ſeeing fire, and hearing noiſe in other places, he went to the gate <hi>Carmentall,</hi> where he found more ſilence then in other places, on the which ſide alſo the hill of the Capitol was more ſteep and upright, by reaſon of the great rocks that were hard to clime up upon: But he digged and crept up ſo long amongſt them that he got up with great pain unto the wall of the Fortreſs, on the which ſide alſo the enemy kept no watch; and ſaluting the watch of the Capitol, he told them what he was, ſo they plucked him up to them, and brought him to the Magiſtrates that ruled them, who cauſed the Senate to aſſemble preſently, to whom he told the news of <hi>Camillus</hi> Victory, which they had not heard of before; and therewith alſo he did declare unto them, the determination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers that were abroad, which was to make <hi>Camillus</hi> their Captain and General, and did perſwade them alſo to grant him the Charge, for that he was the only man abroad, whom the Citizens gave conſent to obey; when they heard this, all that were within the Capitol conſulted thereupon among themſelves, and ſo did chooſe <hi>Camillus</hi> Dictator, and returned the Meſſenger, <hi>Pontius Cominius</hi> back again, the ſelf ſame way he came unto them; this fortune in returning back was like unto his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, for the enemies never ſaw him: And ſo he brought report to them that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of the Senates decree and conſent, whereof they were all marvellous glad. Thus came <hi>Camillus</hi> to take this Charge of General upon him, and found there were twenty thouſand good fighting men abroad and well Armed. Then got he further ayd alſo of their Allies, and Confederates, and prepared daily to go and ſet upon the enemies.

                           </gap>l digging to get hold, and ſaw the weeds alſo, and herbs growing upon the Rocks, and the earth alſo in the like manner flat trodden down; whereupon they went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently unto the King, to let him underſtand the ſame, who forthwith came to view the place, and having conſidered it well, did nothing at that time; but when dark night was come, he called a company of the lighteſt <hi>Gauls</hi> together, and that uſed moſt to dig in Mountains, and ſaid unto them, our enemies themſelves do ſhew us the way how to take them, which we could not have found out but by themſelves; for they having gone up before us, do give us eaſily to underſtand that it is no impoſſible thing for us to clime up alſo, wherefore we were utterly ſhamed, having already began well, if we ſhould fail alſo to end well, and to leave this place as invincible; for if it were eaſie for one man alone, by digging, to clime up to the top there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, much leſs is it hard for many to get up one after another, ſo that one do help the other. Therefore Sirs, I do aſſure you, thoſe that do take the pains to get up, ſhall be honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to their juſt deſert; when the King had ſpoken theſe words unto the <hi>Gauls,</hi> they fell to it luſtily, every man to get up, and about midnight, they began many of them to dig and make ſteps up to the Rock one after another, as ſoftly as could poſſibly, with catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold the beſt they could by the hanging of the Rock, which they found very ſteep, but nevertheleſs, eaſier to clime then they took it at the beginning, ſo that the foremoſt of them being up to the top, were now ready to take the wall, and to ſet upon the Watch, that ſlept; for there was neither man nor dog that heard them. It chanced then there were holy Geeſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61256:28"/> kept in the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> which at other times were wont to be fed till their crops were full: But victuals being very ſtrait and ſcant at that time, even to finde the men, the poor Geeſe were ſo hardly handled, and ſo little regarded that they were in a manner ſtarved for lack of meat: This Fowl indeed naturally is very quick of hearing, and ſo alſo very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by nature, and being in a manner almoſt famiſhed with their hard allowance, they were ſo much the more wakefull and eaſier to be afraid: upon this occaſion therefore, they heard the coming of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and alſo began to run up and down and cry for fear, with which noiſe they did wake thoſe that were within the Caſtle. The <hi>Gauls</hi> being bewrayed by theſe fooliſh Geeſe, left their ſtealing upon them, and came in with all open noiſe and terrour they could. The <hi>Romans</hi> hearing this Alarm every man took ſuch weapon as came firſt to hand, and they run ſuddenly to reſcue that place, from whence they underſtood the noyſe; amongſt thoſe the foremoſt man of all was <hi>Marcus Manlius,</hi> a man that had been Conſull, who had a luſty body, and as ſtout a heart. His hap being to meet with two of the <hi>Gauls</hi> together, as one of them was lifting up his Ax to knock him on the head, he prevented him and ſtruck off his hand with his ſword, and clapt his Target on the others face ſo fiercely, that he threw him backward down the Rock, and coming afterwards unto the Wall with others that ran thither with him, he repulſed the reſt of the <hi>Gauls</hi> that were gotten up, who were not many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> having eſcaped this danger, the next morning they threw the Captain down the Rocks from the Caſtle, who had charge of the Watch the night before; and gave <hi>Manlius</hi> in recompence of the good ſervice he had done, a more honourable then profitable reward, which was this, every man of them gave him half a pound of the Country Wheat which they call <hi>Far:</hi> and the fourth part of the meaſure of wine, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call <hi>Cotile,</hi> and this might be about a Quart, being the ordinarie allowance of every man, by the day.</p>
                        <p>After this Repulſe the <hi>Gauls</hi> began to be diſcouraged, partly for that their victuals failed them, and durſt no more forrage abroad in the fields for fear of <hi>Camillus;</hi> and partly alſo for that the Plague came amongſt them, being lodged amongſt heaps of dead bodies, lying in every place above ground without burial, and amongſt burnt houſes deſtroyed, where the aſhes being blown very high by the wind, and vehemency of heat, did give a dry piercing ayr, that did marvellouſly poyſon their bodies, when they came to draw in the breath of it. But the greateſt cauſe of all their miſchief, was the change of their wonted Diet, who coming out of a freſh Country, where there were excellent pleaſant places to retire unto to avoid the diſcomodity of the parching heat of the Summer, were now in a naughty plain Country for them to remain in, in the later ſeaſon of the year. All theſe things together, did heap diſeaſes upon them, beſides the long continuance of the ſiege about the Capitol (for it was then about the 7. moneth) by reaſon whereof there grew a marvellous death in their Camp, through the great numbers of them that died daily and lay unburied.</p>
                        <p>But notwithſtanding all the death and trouble of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the poor beſieged <hi>Romans</hi> were nothing holpen, and the Famine ſtill did grow upon them: And becauſe they could hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Camillus,</hi> they were almoſt grown into deſpair; and ſend unto him they could not, the <hi>Gauls</hi> kept ſo ſtrait a watch, upon them in the City; whereupon both parties finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in hard eſtate; firſt, the Watch on each ſide began to caſt out words of peace amongſt themſelves; and afterwards by conſent of the heads, <hi>Sulpitius</hi> Tribune of the Souldiers came to parley with <hi>Brennus.</hi> In which parley it was articuled, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould pay a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound weight of gold; and that the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſhould incontinently, after the Receit of the ſame depart out of their City, and all their Territories; this decree being paſſed by oath from both, the gold was brought: And when it came to be weighed, the <hi>Gauls</hi> at the firſt, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily began to deal falſely with them; but afterwards they openly ſtayed the balance, and would let them weigh no more, whereat the <hi>Romans</hi> began to be angry with them; then <hi>Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in ſcorn and mockery, to deſpite them the more, pluckt off his ſword belt and all, and put it into the balance where the Gold was weighed. <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> ſeeing that, askt him, what he meant by it? <hi>Brennus</hi> anſwered him, What can it ſignifie elſe, but ſorrow to the vanquiſhed? This word ever after ran as a common Proverb in the Peoples mouths. Some of the <hi>Romans</hi> took this vile part of theirs in ſuch ſcorn, that they would needs take the Gold from them again by force, and ſo return unto their Hold to abide the Siege ſtill, as they had done before; others were of opinion to the contrary; and thought it beſt with patience, to put up this ſcorn of theirs, and not to think it was ſhame to pay more then they had promiſed; but only to pay it by compulſion as they did by misfortune of time, was rather to think neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then honourable.</p>
                        <p>And as they were debating the matter thus, as well amongſt themſelves as the <hi>Gauls, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> gates with his Army, and underſtanding all that had paſſed between them, he comands the reſt of the Army to march fair and ſoftly after him in good order; and he himſelf in the mean ſeaſon, with the beſt choice men he had, went before with all ſpeed. As ſoon as the other <hi>Romans</hi> within the City had ſpied him, they ſhouted for joy, and every one with great reverence received him, without any more words, as their Soveraign Prince and Captain, who had power over them all: And <hi>Camillus</hi> taking the gold out of the ſcales, gave it unto his men, and commanded the <hi>Gauls</hi> preſently to take up the ſcales, and to get them going; for ſaid he, it is not the <hi>Romans</hi> manner to keep their Country with gold, but with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61256:28"/> the ſword: then <hi>Brennus</hi> began to be hot, and told him it was not honourably done of him to break the accord that had paſſed between them before by oath, whereunto <hi>Camillus</hi> ſtoutly anſwered him again, that accord was of no validity; for he being Dictator was before all other Officers and Magiſtrates whatſoever; and their acts by his election were made of no authority: And ſeeing therefore that they had dealt with men that had no power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to accord to any matter, they were to ſpeak to him, if they required ought; for he alone had alſo late power to pardon them if they repented, and would ask it; or elſe to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, and make their bodies anſwer the damage and loſs his Country had ſuſtained by them: Theſe words made <hi>Brennus</hi> as mad as a March Hare, that out went his blade; then they drew their ſwords on all ſides, and laid luſtily one at another, as they could within the houſes, and in open ſtreets, where they could ſet no Battel in order; but <hi>Brennus</hi> ſuddenly remembring himſelf, that it was no even match for him, retired with his men about him into his Camp before he had loſt many of his people. The next night following he departed out of <hi>Rome</hi> with all his Army, and went to encamp himſelf about threeſcore Furlongs; from thence in the high way that goeth towards the City of the <hi>Gabians, Camillus</hi> with his whole Army, well appointed, went after him immediately, and ſhewed himſelf at his Camp by break of day. The <hi>Romans</hi> having taken heart again unto them, did luſtily give them Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, the ſame continued very long cruel and doubtfull, till at length the <hi>Gauls</hi> were overcome, and their Camp taken with great ſlaughter: As for thoſe that did eſcape the fury of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, they were killed ſome by the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, who hotly followed the chaſe after the Battel broken; and the reſidue of them, and the greateſt part were ſlain by thoſe of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Villages near abouts, that did ſet upon them as they fled here and there ſcattering in the field: Hitherto <hi>Plutarch;</hi> and moſt likely it is, that the Heroick <hi>Brittain,</hi> the moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious <hi>Brennus,</hi> here alſo periſhed; and therefore we will return to his brother.</p>

But the <hi>Gauls</hi> having ſuffered hunger and hard marches, finding the Country well furiſhed with Wines and other welcome Proviſions, leaving their Colours, diſperſe themſelves every one according to his own pleaſure and liking, and as if already all were their own, like Conquerors they ſtrut it up and down. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſſe gives opportunity to the <hi>Delphians</hi> by the Auxiliary Forces of their Friends and Neighbours to fortifie their Town and reinforce their Garriſon; which <hi>Brennus</hi> perceiving, ſends out Command for every man ſpeedily to repair to his Colours, whoſe minds were ſet upon nothing but looking to their bellies and quaffing luſty bowls. The Army of the <hi>Gauls</hi> conſiſted of ſixty thouſand Foot; the Citizens of <hi>Delphos</hi> had only fourteen thouſand fighting Men, <hi>Brennus</hi> undervaluing this ſlender handfull of Men in reſpect of the numerous Troops of his Souldiers, made himſelf cock-ſure of the Victory; and therefore to encourage his Men the more, he wiſh'd them to behold and conſider, the richneſs of the Treaſure, and greatneſs of the Spoil which was like to fall unto their ſhare, the Statues and Images together with their Chariots if not made, at leaſt covered over with pure and ſolid Gold. The greedy Souldier eaſily ſwallowed up his golden Bait, and elevated, and inebriated with the blood of the luſty grape, without either Order or command (being ſufficiently armed with <hi>Bachus</hi> to ſet all danger at defiance) runs headlong into Battel; on the contrary, the wary <hi>Delphians,</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more in the protection of their God than ſtrength of their humane Forces, from the high and towring Top of the cloud, kiſſing <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> (where ſtood <hi>Apollos</hi> ſtately Temple) with ſtones and other ſuch Materials, beſides the help of their Weapons, beat down, and headlong precipitated the aſpiring <hi>Gauls:</hi> this their endeavour was ſeconded by a ſudden and hideous Earthquake, which ſo broke the Ranks of the amazed yet furious Aſſailants, and ſo diſordered their beſt ordered Squadrons, that what with a ſudden fear &amp; what with thoſe unwonted kinds of wounds, they were totally diſperſt and overthrown. <hi>Brennus</hi> whoſe haughty ſpirit not long before was puft up with preſumption of winning golden Mountains, is now no longer able to endure his late received wounds; and therefore with one ſtroke to put a period to all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, he ſheatheth his fatal Dagger with a more then manlike thruſt in the moſt remote angle of his own entrails.</p>

                        <p>It is great reaſon that Princes ſhould regulate their lives after the true ſquare of vertue; for a Prince cannot with reaſon expect that the ſeverity of Laws, or other Politick means ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in his Commonwealth, any Vice which ſhall be Authoriſed by the Example of his own Practice.

                           </q> That is to ſay, all the World is framed after the modell of the King; and no Laws or Edicts can ſo move the mind of men as doth the life of the Governour; which <hi>Plutarch</hi> confirmeth notably, ſaying, <hi>That even as a Square or Rule muſt be ſtreight in it ſelf before it can make other things ſtreight; ſo the Prince who is, as it were, the Rule of his Subjects, ought firſt to rectifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before he go about by Laws or other means to rectifie his Commonwealth; for he that is falling, ſaith</hi> Plutarch, <hi>is not fit to uphold others, nor he that is ignorant to teach, nor he that is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible to correct, nor he that is himſelf diſordered to put others in order.</hi>

This Prince in the Engliſh Chronicle is called <hi>Artogail,</hi> who utterly forſaking the model of exact Government which his Brother had left behind him for him to follow, he lent too facile an ear to flatterers and ſycophants; and where no juſt cauſe could be found, faults were contrived and invented whereby to entrap the Nobles, and new Plots diſcovered which never were thought upon but by the Contrivers, whoſe <hi>Machiavillian</hi> brains hatch'd them for the deſtruction of the valiant and wealthy, were they never ſo innocent: a point of policy ſo palpably manifeſt in theſe latter dayes, that the weakeſt judgement may ſee it, but the greateſt dare not gain-ſay it. Theſe ſtate tricks pleaſed <hi>Archigallo;</hi> the ancient Nobility are thruſt out of all command and power in the Commonwealth, Delinquency laid to their charge, or at leaſt a diſaffection to the preſent Government; and upon theſe pretences, many are ſecured, and more utterly ruined, either being put to ſuch an intolerable Compoſition for their Eſtates, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after rec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It concerns Princes and great Commanders to make choice of Counſellors who not only have the reputation of vertue and Religion, but alſo that be indeed truly vertuous &amp; religious; For two Cauſes; The firſt thereby to obtain the aſſiſtance of God's grace, which how neceſſary it is for the illumination of mans underſtanding in all matters of Counſel, is moſt evident to all good Men. The ſecond Cauſe why it behoveth a Counſellor to be truly religious and vertuous, is, for that ſuch is the force of vertue that it giveth credit to the Poſſeſſors thereof, and maketh them the more eaſily believed, and their Counſel better accepted; And therefore we ſee that all men of diſcretion and judgement do demand Counſel rather of thoſe who are reputed wiſe and vertuous, then of wicked men who have onely the reputation of wiſdom; For as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Amb. li. de offi. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>

                        <p>But this muſt be done with great moderation and diſcretion; for commonly thoſe do offend in this kind (I mean of being forward and rigorous in admoniſhing) who preſume over much either of their own wits and power, or of their Princes weakneſſe, or of his over great favour and familiarity, or of the need he hath of them, or elſe perhaps are of nature ſevere, inſolent or paſſionate; for ſuch ſometimes do forget themſelves, yea and take a pride in contradicting or admoniſhing their Princes with leſs duty &amp; reſpect then were convenient; and ſuch an one was <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> of whom <hi>Arrianus</hi> writeth, that he made himſelf odious to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Tum ob intempeſtivam libertatem, tum ob ſuperbam ſtultitiam,</hi> both for his unſeaſonable liberty of ſpeech, and alſo for his proud folly.

                        <p>The firſt is all ſorts of falſe Religion, Superſtition, Idolatry, Hereſy, and Schiſme, and ſuch ſins as do belong thereto. The ſecond is all ſort of Injuſtice, as Rapine, Immoderate exactions, Oppreſſion of the poor, effuſion of innocent blood, and calumniation or ſlander and ſuch like, for the which God puniſheth Kingdoms and States, at the Holy Ghoſt ſignifyeth in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Regnum de gente in gentem transferetur,</hi> &amp;c. A kingdome is transferred from Nation to Nation for injuſtice, injuries, calumniations or ſlanders and divers deceits. The third kind conſiſteth of Licentiouſneſs, Drunkenneſs, and diſſolutneſs of life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This Drunken King left after him three Sons, <hi>Fulgenius, Eldad,</hi> and <hi>Androgeos,</hi> who ſucceſſively Reigned in this Kingdome.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Hereunto I may add another notable example of the overthrow of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the loſſe of the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> by the juſt judgement of God, as both <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> and others affirm; the ſtory is this.</p>
                        <p>Two <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> paſſing over the plain of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> were lodged and courteouſly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the houſe of one <hi>Scadaſus,</hi> who had two handſome Women to his daughters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning that way ſhortly after, and finding the two young Women at home and their Father abſent, firſt raviſht one, after kill'd them both; their father at his return finding his daughters ſlain, and underſtanding who had been the doers of it, went to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to crave juſtice againſt the Malefactors; but ſo potent were they and their friends there, that he could by no means obtain it: whereupon after infinite maledictions poured forth in the ſorrow of his heart againſt them and their ſtate, he went home and deſperately kil'd himſelf upon the grave of his Daughters. Not long after Wars growing between the <hi>Thebans</hi> and the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> the ſoul of <hi>Scadaſus</hi> appeared to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> (one of the chief Captaines of the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>) and encouraged him to give battel to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the plain of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> where he and his daughters were buried: telling him that their death ſhould be there revenged, and ſo afterwards it fell out; for the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> loſt not only the battel, but alſo the Empire of <hi>Greece:</hi> we will omit the burning of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> for the ſin of luſt, and alſo the rape which thoſe of the town of <hi>Gabaa</hi> committed upon the wife of a <hi>Levit,</hi> for which <hi>percuſſit eos Dominus in conſpectu filiorum</hi> Iſrael, who killed of them 25100 men that bore Armes.</p>
                        <p>But come a little nearer to our times; concerning the puniſhment of the ſins of the fleſh, we have a notable and fearful example thereof in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> conquered by the <hi>Moors,</hi> and poſſeſſed by them 700 years for that offence. For when the Kingdome had flouriſhed as well in religion as power, from the time of K. <hi>Recared</hi> (the firſt Catholick King thereof, the ſpace of 120 years: the wicked King <hi>Vitiza</hi> being a man (like this our <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rianus</hi>) given over to luſt and carnality, infected and corrupted all <hi>Spain,</hi> not only with the bad example of his own diſſolute life, (having divers Wives at once beſides many Concubines) but alſo with abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Laws, whereby he gave leave to all ſorts of men to have as many Wives &amp; Concubines as they liſted, yea and forced Prieſts and ſuch as would have lived chaſt to marry, by which means all <hi>Spain</hi> became within a while to be no better then a common Stew or Brothel. And although Almighty God according to his accuſtomed mercy expected their converſion and amendment all the time of that Kings Reign, and laid onely the penalty thereof upon him whom he deprived both of his Crown and his eye-ſight, by the means of <hi>Roderick</hi> who ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed him in the Kingdome: yet when the ſaid <hi>Roderick</hi> followed his ſteps as well in his vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life as in the maintenance of his abominable Laws, it pleaſed God of his juſtice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to give the occaſion both of his own ruine and alſo of the overthrow of all <hi>Spain</hi> by the ſin of the fleſh, wherewith the whole Kingdome was as it were overflowed.</p>
                        <p>For whereas King <hi>Roderick</hi> had ſent a Kinſman of his own Count <hi>Julian</hi> Embaſſador into <hi>Affrick,</hi> and in the mean time raviſhed his Daughter, or (as ſome write) his wife; the Count underſtanding it at his return, was ſo incenſed therewith againſt the King, that in revenge thereof he practiſed with the <hi>Moores</hi> to bring them into <hi>Spain,</hi> who with his aſſiſtance conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſpeedily, and with ſuch deſtruction of the people, that the puniſhment of God was evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen therein. For having firſt overthrown King <hi>Roderick</hi> (whoſe body could never after the Battail be found) they ſubdued almoſt all <hi>Spain</hi> in eight Months, or in fourteen, as ſome ſay, and ſlew 700000 of all ſorts of people, beſides great numbers of Captives which they ſent Priſoners into <hi>Barbary;</hi> and from that time forward remained in the poſſeſſion of that Kingdome, or of ſome part thereof for the ſpace of 700 years.</p>

Their apparel was made of the skins of Beaſts, though their bodies were for the moſt part naked and ſtained with woad, which gave them a blewiſh colour, and as they ſuppoſed, made their Aſpect terrible to their Enemies in Battail. Their<note n="b" place="margin">Yet had they Cities wald, and ſtrong; this muſt be underſtood of thoſe which we now call Peaſants and Cottagers.</note> Houſes were compact of ſtakes, reeds and boughes of trees faſtned together in a round Circle. They had ten or twelve wives a piece common among them, though the iſſue were alwayes accounted his that firſt married the Mother being a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. They were in ſtature taller then the <hi>Gauls;</hi> by this time <hi>Voluſenus</hi> (who durſt not ſet foot on land to hazard himſelf among the Ilanders) returned to <hi>Cæſar</hi> (to wit, the fifth day after his ſetting forth) and made relation of ſuch things as he had ſeen and heard by report in roving up and down the Coaſt in view of the Iland.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cæſar</hi> having compoſed ſome Tumults in the hither part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> that he might leave no Enemy behind him to annoy him in his abſenee, purſued the Enterprize of <hi>Brittain,</hi> having to that end prepared a Navy, which conſiſted of about fourſcore Ships of burden (a number ſufficient) as he thought, for the tranſportation of two Legions, beſides his long Boats, wherein the <hi>Queſtor,</hi> the Lieutenant, and other Officers of the Camp were to be embarked; There were alſo eighten ſhips of burden (that lay wind bound about eight miles from the Port) appointed to waft over the Horſe-men. <hi>P. Pulpitius Rufus,</hi> a Lieutenant of a Legion was commanded to keep the Haven it ſelf with ſuch power as was thought ſufficient. Theſe things being thus ordered, and a good part of the ſummer being now ſpent, <hi>Cæſar</hi> put out to Sea about the third watch of the night, having given direction, that the Horſemen ſhould embarke in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Haven, and follow him; wherein while they were ſomewhat ſlack, <hi>Cæſar</hi> with his ſhipping about the fourth hour of the day Arrived upon the Coaſt of <hi>Brittain,</hi> where he beheld the Clifts poſſeſſed with a multitude of people rudely armed, but ready to make reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>The nature of the place was ſuch, as by reaſon of the ſteep hills (encloaſing the Sea on each ſide in a narrow ſtrait) it gave great advantage to the <hi>Brittains,</hi> in caſting down their darts upon their Enemies underneath them. <hi>Cæſar</hi> finding this place unfit for landing his Forces, put off from the ſhore and caſt Anchor, expecting the reſt of his Fleet; and in the mean time calling a Council of the Lieutenants and Tribunes of the Souldiers, he declared unto them, what he had underſtood by <hi>Voluſenus,</hi> and directed what he would have done, warning them that (as the ſtate of War, and eſpecially the Sea ſervice required) they would be ready to weigh Anchor and to remove Too and Fro upon all occaſions at a beek, and in an inſtant.</p>
                        <p>This done, having advantage both of Wind and Tide, he ſet forward with his Navy about four League from that place, and then lay at Anchor in view of the open and plain ſhore; But the <hi>Ilanders</hi> upon intelligence of the <hi>Romans</hi> purpoſe had ſent thither (before <hi>Cæſars</hi> coming) a company of Horſemen and Chariots called <hi>Eſſeda</hi> (which they then uſed in their Wars) and following afterwards with the reſt of their Forces, empeached their Enemies from Landing, whoſe ſhips by reaſon of their huge bulks (drawing much water) could not come near to the ſhore, ſo as the Roman Souldiers were thereby enforced in places unknown (their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being charged with their Armour) to leap into the water and encounter the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who aſſailed them nimbly with their Darts, and drove their Horſes and Chariots with main force upon them. The <hi>Romans</hi> being therewith terrified, as Men unacquainted with that kind of Fight, failed much of the wonted courage which they had ſhewed in their former land Services; and <hi>Cæſar</hi> perceiving it, cauſed the long boats which ſeemed more ſtrange to the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> and were more ſerviceable by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of their motion, to put off by little and little from the great Ships, and to Row towards the ſhore, from whence they might more eaſily charge the <hi>Ilanders,</hi> with their Arrowes, Slings and other Warlike Engines, which (being then unknown to the Inhabitants, as alſo the faſhion of the ſhips and motion of the Oares in the long Boats, having ſtricken them with fear and amazement) cauſed them to make a ſtand and afterwards to draw back a little. But the Roman Souldiers making no haſte to purſue them, by reaſon of the water which they ſuſpected in ſome place to be deep and dangerous, the Standerd-bearer of the Eagle for the tenth Legion, praying that his attempt might prove ſuccesful, then the Legion cryed out with a loud voice ſaying, <hi>Fellow Souldiers leap out of your Boats, and follow me, except you mean to betray your Standard to the Enemy; for my own part, I mean to diſcharge the duty I owe to the Commonwealth, and to my Generall;</hi> This ſaid, he caſt himſelf into the water, and carried the Standard boldly againſt the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> whereupon the Souldiers exhorting one another to follow the Enſign what fortune ſo ever befel, with a common conſent leapt out of their long Boats, one ſeconding another, and ſo wading through the water, at length got to ſhore, where began a ſharp and bloody Fight on both ſides. The <hi>Romans</hi> were much Incumbred by reaſon that they could neither keep their ranks nor fight upon firm ground, nor follow their own Standard; for every one as he came on Land, ran confuſedly to that which was next him; ſome of the <hi>Brittains</hi> who knew the flats and ſhallow places, eſpying the <hi>Romans</hi> as they came ſingle out of their ſhips, pricked forward their horſes and ſet upon them, overlaying them with number, and finding them unwieldy and unready to make any great reſiſtance, by reaſon of the depth of the water, and weight of their Armour, while the greater part of the Natives with their Darts aſſailed them fierely upon the ſhore, which <hi>Cæſar</hi> perceiving, commanded the Cock-boats and Scouts to be Manned with Souldiers whom he ſent in all haſte to reſcue their Fellows.</p>

                        <p>There was a Souldier of <hi>Cæſars</hi> Company called <hi>Caſſius Scaeva,</hi> who with ſome other of the ſame Band, was carried in a ſmall Boat unto the Rock, which the ebbing Sea in that place had make acceſſible. The <hi>Brittains</hi> eſpying them, made thitherwards: the reſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> eſcaping, <hi>Scaeva</hi> was left alone upon the Rock, to which Iſland the fury of the enraged mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude aſſailed him with their darts, which he received upon his Shield, and thruſt at them with his Spear till it was broken, and his Helmet and Shield loſt: then being tyred with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme toyl, and dangerouſly wounded, he betook himſelf to flight (carrying two little Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes on his back) with much difficulty recovered <hi>Cæſars</hi> Tent, where he craved pardon for making ſo bold an attempt without commandment of his General. <hi>Cæſar</hi> did both remit the Offence, and rewarded the Offender by beſtowing upon him the Office of a <hi>Centurion.</hi> This was that <hi>Scaeva</hi> who afterwards gave good cauſe to have his Name remembred in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories for the memorable ſervice he did to <hi>Cæſar,</hi> in the time of the civil Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Pompey</hi> at the battail near <hi>Dyrrachium.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> having at length got footing on the dry land, gave a freſh charge unto the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and in the end forced them to turn their backs, and leave the ſhore, though they could not purſue them far into the Land for want of Horſemen, <hi>Cæſars</hi> accuſtomed Fortune failing him in this one accident.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Brittains</hi> after this overthrow aſſembling themſelves together (upon conſultation had amongſt them) ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Cæſar,</hi> promiſing to deliver in pledges, or to do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe he would command them: With theſe Embaſſadors came <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras,</hi> whom <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had ſent before out of <hi>Gallia</hi> into <hi>Brittain,</hi> where having delivered the Meſſage he had then in charge, he was apprehended and committed to Priſon, and now after the battel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed. The chief States of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> ſeeking to excuſe their attempt, laid the blame upon the multitude, who being the greater number, and wilfully bent to take Arms, would neither by perſwaſion nor Authority be reſtrained: And they pretended their own ignorance as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free people, and not experienced in the Cuſtomes of other Nations. <hi>Cæſar</hi> although he reproved them for making War in that manner, conſidering that of their own accord, they had ſent Embaſſadors to him, before his arrival in <hi>Brittany</hi> to deſire peace; yet was content to pardon them upon delivery of pledges, whereof ſome he received preſently, and the reſt being to come from remote places, he appointed to be ſent in by a ſet day; ſo the <hi>Brittains</hi> were diſmiſſed to return into their Countries; and in the mean time there came divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from other parts of the Iſle to ſubmit themſelves and their Cities to <hi>Cæſar.</hi> The fourth day after, the <hi>Romans</hi> Landing the ſhips before mentioned, appointed for Tranſportation of <hi>Cæſars</hi> Horſe men, having a favourable Gail of wind, put out to Sea from the upper Haven; and approaching near the Iſland in view of the Roman Camp, a ſuddain ſtorme aroſe and ſcattered them, driving ſome back again to the Port from whence they came, and ſome others upon the lower part of the Iſland Weſtward, where after they had caſt Anchor, (their Keeles being all moſt overwhelmed with the Waves) they were carried by violence of the ſtorm in the night into the Main, and with very great peril recovered a harbour in the Continent.</p>
                        <p>The ſame night the Moon was at the full, at which time commonly the Sea in thoſe parts is much troubled, and overfloweth the banks by reaſon of the high Tides (a matter unknown unto the <hi>Romans</hi>) inſomuch as the long Boats which tranſported the Army, then lying upon the ſhore, were filled with the flood, and the ſhips of burden that lay at Anchor were beaten with the ſtorm and ſplit in pieces, the greater number of them periſhing in the water, and the reſt being made altogether unſerviceable (the Anchors loſt and Tacklings broken) wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> were much perplexed, for that they neither had any other ſhips to tranſport them back again, nor any means to repair what the Tempeſt had Ruined; and <hi>Cæſar</hi> had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to winter in <hi>Gallia,</hi> by reaſon he was unfurniſhed of victuals to maintaine his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, during the Winter ſeaſon: which being known to the chief States of the <hi>Brittains</hi> (who had met together about the accompliſhment of ſuch things as <hi>Cæſar</hi> had commanded them) they ſuppoſed a fit opportunity was offered them to revolt, while the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſhipping and all manner of proviſions; the number of their Forces ſeeming alſo the leſſe, in reſpect of the ſmall circuit of their Camp (<hi>Cæſar</hi> having tranſported his Legions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Carriages, or ſuch like Warlike neceſſaries) whereupon they concluded to keep them from Victuals, and to prolong the War till Winter; aſſuring themſelves that if they could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanquiſh the <hi>Romans,</hi> or bar them from returning thence, there would no Forraigne Nation after them adventure to ſet foot again in <hi>Brittany;</hi> and hereupon they conveyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſtealth out of the Roman Camp, and gathered company to them privily from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts to make head againſt their Enemies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cæſar,</hi> albeit he was ignorant of the <hi>Brittains</hi> purpoſe, yet ſuppoſing that the State of his Army and the loſs of his ſhips were to them known, and conſidering that they had broken day with him, in detaining the pledges contrary to the contract, he ſuſpected that which afterwards proved true; And therefore to provide remedies againſt all chances, he cauſed<note n="b" place="margin">The <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Agriculture, as ſom aver they then were, as the Author from whom I took this, ſeemeth to ſay.</note> Corn to be brought daily out of the Fields into his Camp; and ſuch ſhips as could not be made fit for ſervice were uſed to repair the reſt, and ſuch other things as were wanting thereto, he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be brought out of the ſame continent; by which means and the diligence of his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by loſſe of twelve ſhips, the reſt of the Navy was made able to bear ſail, and brook the Seas again: while theſe things were in doing, the ſeventh Legion (according to cuſtome) was ſent forth a Forraging, till which time the <hi>Brittains</hi> revolt was not certainly known, for that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61256:48"/> ſome of them remained abroad in the Fields, and others came ordinarily into the Roman Camp; The Warders in the ſtation before the Camp, gave notice to <hi>Cæſar</hi> that the ſame way which the Legion went, there appeared a greater duſt then was wont to be ſeen; <hi>Cæſar</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting ſome new practice of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> commanded the Companies (that kept Ward) to march thither, appointing two others to ſupply their rooms, and the reſt of his Forces to Arme themſelves with ſpeed and follow him; when he approached near the place diſcried, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Souldiers to be over-charged by the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who aſſailed them on all ſides with darts; For the <hi>Brittains</hi> having commanded their Corn from all other parts (this onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed) and ſuſpecting that the <hi>Romans</hi> would come thither, lay in the woods all night to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texcept them: and finding them diſperſed and unready, they ſuddenly ſet upon them (as they were reaping) killing a few of them and diſordering the reſt with their Horſes and Chariots.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The manner of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> fighting in Chariots</note>The manner of their fighting in Chariots was thus; Firſt they uſed to ride round about their Enemies Forces, caſting their Darts where they ſaw advantage, and often times with the fierceneſſe of their Horſes, and whirling of their Chariots wheels, they broak their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ranks: and being gotten in among the Troops of Horſemen, they would leap out of their Chariots and Fight on Foot. The Chariot-drivers in the mean time withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by little and little out of the battle, and placed themſelves in ſuch ſort, as their Maſters (being over matched by their Enemies) might readily recover their Chariots, ſo that in their Fighting they performed the Offices both of Horſemen in ſwiftneſs of motion, and alſo of Footmen in keeping of ground: and by daily uſe and exerciſe they were grown ſo expert in managing their Horſes as driving them forcibly down a deep hill, they were able to ſtay or turn them in the midway, yea to run along the beam, to ſtand firm upon the yoak, and to return thence ſpeedily into their Chariots again.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being much troubled with this new kind of fight, <hi>Cæſar</hi> came in good time to the reſcue; for upon his approach the <hi>Brittains</hi> gave over the Skirmiſh, yet keeping ſtill their ground as Maſters of the Field; and the <hi>Romans</hi> for fear, retired themſelves to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who thought it no point of wiſdome to hazard his Forces in a place unknown: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtaid there a while, conducted the Legions back again to his Camp, and in the mean time, the <hi>Brittains</hi> that were in the Field diſperſed themſelves and ſhrunk away. After this there were many dayes together continual tempeſts, which kept the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Camp, and hindred the <hi>Brittains</hi> from making any open attempt; though they ſent Meſſengers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly into divers parts of the Ile, publiſhing abroad what a ſmall number of their enemies were left, what hope there was of a rich booty, and what apparent likelyhood of recovering their liberty, if they drive the <hi>Romans</hi> from their Camp: and hereupon in ſhort time they aſſembled a great number of Horſe and Foot men to put their purpoſe in execution. Againſt the which (<hi>Cæſar</hi> underſtanding thereof) made preparation for Defence, having gotten alſo about him thirty Horſe men, (which <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> brought over with him) whoſe ſervice he ſuppoſed very neceſſary, if the <hi>Brittains</hi> (according to their wonted manner) ſhould ſeek to ſave themſelves by flight; The Legions were placed in battle Array, before the Camp. Then the <hi>Brittains</hi> began to Fight, which had not long continued, when they gave back and fled, the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing them as far as they durſt, killing many whom they overtook, and burning Houſes and Towns as they returned to their Camp. The ſame day the <hi>Brittains</hi> ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Cæſar</hi> deſiring peace, which after long ſute was granted upon Conditions, that the Pledges (which was before required) ſhould be now doubled, and ſpeedily ſent over into <hi>Gallia.</hi> For the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> drawing neer, <hi>Cæſar</hi> made haſte thither, doubting his craſed ſhips would not be well able to brook the Seas in Winter: whereupon taking advantage of the next fair wind, he embarqued his Forces about midnight, and with the greateſt part of his Fleet Arrived in the <hi>Continent.</hi> The Roman Senate (upon Relation of theſe his Services) decreed a Supplication for him, for the ſpace of twenty dayes.</p>
                        <p>In the ſpring of the year following, <hi>Cæſar</hi> having pacified ſome tumults in <hi>Gallia,</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the enterpriſe of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and to that end he had prepared a Fleet of new ſhips, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and commodiouſly built for landing his Forces, (the want whereof he had found before to his great loſſe) and a ſufficient Army conſiſtent of five Legions, and a proportionable number of Horſe which he embarked at<note n="*" place="margin">Calis</note> 
                           <hi>Portus Iccius</hi> about Sun ſetting: having a faire Southern wind to ſet them forward, which failing them about midnight, the Tide diverted their courſe, ſo as in the morning he diſcovered the Iſland on his left hand, and then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the turning of the Tide, he commanded his Souldiers to uſe their Oares, that they might reach that part of the Iſle, where they had found the beſt landing the ſummer before; wherein they took ſuch pains, as their ſhips of burden kept way with their long boats and lighter Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; about noon they landed on the ſhore, where there appeared no man to make reſiſtance; the cauſe whereof was (as <hi>Cæſar</hi> afterwards learned by ſuch Priſoners as he took) for that the <hi>Brittains</hi> having aſſembled themſelves together in Armes at the Sea ſide, were ſo terrified with the ſight of the ſhips (which of all ſorts were eſteemed above eight hundred ſayle) that they left the ſhore, and ran to hide themſelves in the Upland Countries; <hi>Cæſar</hi> (upon intelligence of Fugitives, where the Brittiſh Forces lay) leaving at the Sea ſide ten Chariots, and three hundred Horſe to guard the ſhips then lying at Anchor (whereof <hi>Quintus Atrius</hi> had the charge) Marched forward with the reſt of his Army in the night about twelve miles into the

                           <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> and to raiſe a Mount againſt the place; by which means after loſs of men on both ſides, the <hi>Romans</hi> in the end got the Fort, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Brittains</hi> over the wood; but <hi>Cæſar</hi> would not ſuffer his Souldiers to purſue them; for in regard the place was unknown, and a great part of the day being ſpent, he thought it fit to beſtow the reſt in fortifying the Camp. The next day in the morning he ſent out Horſemen and Footmen three ſeveral wayes to purſue them that fled; but before they had gotten ſight of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> certain Horſemen ſent from <hi>Quintus Atrius</hi> (who had charge of the ſhipping) brought news that a great Tempeſt the night before had diſtreſſed his ſhips, and beaten them upon the ſhore, the Anchors and Cabels being not able to hold them, nor the Mariners to guide them, or to endure the force of the ſtorm; whereupon <hi>Cæſar</hi> cauſed the Legions and Horſemen to be ſent for back again, and marched with ſpeed towards the Sea ſide, where he found his Navy in ill plight; forty of his ſhips being clean caſt away, and the reſt with great difficulty ſeeming likely to be recovered: for effecting whereof he took ſome ſhip-rights out of the Legions, and ſent for others out of the <hi>Continent,</hi> writing to <hi>Labienus</hi> who had the charge of certain Legions there, and the guard of <hi>Portus Iccius,</hi> that he ſhould prepare as many ſhips as he could to be ſent over to him with expedition; and though it were a work of great toyle, yet he thought it neceſſary to have all the ſhips haled on ſhore, and to be brought into the Camp where his Land-forces lay, that one place might be a ſafe-guard to them both; in the accompliſhment hereof he ſpent ten dayes (the Souldiers ſcarce intermitting their labour in the night time) till all was finiſhed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cæſar</hi> having fortifide his Camp, and left there the ſame Forces, (which were before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to keep the harbour) returned to the place whence he diſlodged, upon <hi>Atrius</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, where he found the number of the <hi>Brittains</hi> much increaſed by confluence of people from ſundry parts within the Iſland; The chief Commandment and direction for the War, was by publick conſent of the States of the Iſle aſſigned to <hi>Caſſibelin,</hi> the bounds of whoſe Territorie were divided from the <hi>Maritime</hi> Cities, by the River <hi>Thameſis,</hi> and were caſt out from the Sea about fourſcore miles. There had been of long time continuall War between him, and ſome other Princes of the Countries near adjoyning: but now (both parts fearing to be over-run by a Forraign Enemy) neglected private reſpects, and joyned their Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, appointing him to be their Leader, as a man of whoſe valour and ſufficiency in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs they had good experience. The Roman Army being come in view of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Camp, the <hi>Brittains</hi> preſſed forward to begin the Fight with their Horſemen and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and <hi>Cæſar</hi> ſent out his Horſemen to Encounter them, ſo as the battle was maintained with great reſolution on both parts, and the event thereof ſeemed doubtful, till in the end the <hi>Brittains</hi> gave ground, and fled through the woods to the hills, many of them being ſlain in the Chaſe, and ſome of the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo who adventurouſly purſued them ſo far.</p>
                        <p>Not long after the <hi>Romans</hi> (ſuſpecting no danger) were occupied in fortifying their Camp, the <hi>Brittains</hi> ſallyed ſuddenly out of the Woods and made an Aſſault upon the Warders that kept ſtation before the Campe; to whoſe aid <hi>Cæſar</hi> ſent out two Cohorts (the chief of the two Legions) which making a lane through the middeſt of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Forces joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their diſtreſſed Fellowes, and reſcued them from the peril, though <hi>Quintus Liberius Durus,</hi> a Tribune of the Souldiers, was ſlain in that Enterprize: But new Cohorts coming to ſupply the former, the <hi>Brittains</hi> were repulſed, and ſought to ſave themſelves by flight.

Hereupon divers petty ſtates thereabout ſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and yielded themſelves to <hi>Cæſar,</hi> who underſtood by them that <hi>Caſſibelina</hi> his Town (being well ſtored with Men and Cattle) was not far from thence; this Town was only a circuit of ground incloſed with wood and marſhes, or elſe entrenched with a Ranger of Earth about it: <hi>Cæſar</hi> coming with his Legion to this place (which he found very ſtrong, as being fortifyed Naturally, and alſo by the induſtry of man) began to aſſail it on both ſides.

In this Army (as tells us the Engliſh Chronicle and <hi>Gaufride</hi>) was a Captain called <hi>Hame</hi> or <hi>Hamo,</hi> who to compaſſe his purpoſe againſt the Ilanders, changed his Armour and Shield, arming himſelf like a <hi>Brittain,</hi> and in this Diſguiſe did extreme Damage unto his Enemies; and ſtill preſſing forward, at length came to the very place where King <hi>Guiderius</hi> was fighting, and by this unexpected Stratagem and Policy ſlew him; which his Brother <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viragus</hi> perceiving, uſed the like policy, immediately inveſting himſelf in Princely Array, that the Fall of the King was not perceived; and thus perſonating a Soveraign in his Regal Enſignes, he encouraged the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and by his own Example, Courage and Valour, ſo animated them, that they did Feats beyond belief, inſomuch that they put the <hi>Romans</hi> to flight.</p>

On the Weſt of this Town is mounted a beautiful Caſtle in form Circular, and wall within wall, the Foundation upon a hill ſo topped, that it cannot be aſcended but by ſtairs, carrying a goodly proſpect both by Land and Sea, and in the Eaſt without the Walls a goodly Church ſometimes ſtood, called St <hi>Maries,</hi> which was pulled down, for that it gave the French direction of Courſe, who with fire had greatly endangered the Town; inſtead thereof is newly Erected a ſmall and unfiniſht Chappel. In this place, ſaith Learned <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> ſtood the ancient <hi>Clauſentium,</hi> a Fort of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Circuit on that ſide extended it ſelf to the Sea: this ſuffered many depredations by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Pirates, and <hi>in Anno,</hi> 980. was by the <hi>Danes</hi> almoſt quite overthrown.

                        <p>Some of the <hi>Brittains</hi> being ſlain, and others taken priſoners, the night made an end of the skirmiſh; The next morning the reſt of the diſperſed rout ſhewed themſelves upon the ſhore, and gave occaſions of a new Fight, which continued a long time with equall advantage, till <hi>C. Sydius Geta</hi> being in danger to have been taken, recovered himſelf, and at the laſt enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Brittains</hi> to retire; For which ſervice he had afterwards triumphal honors aſſigned him, although he were no Conſul; in this conflict <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> (being beſet round about with the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>) was in great danger, either to have been ſlain or taken, if he had not been timely reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued by <hi>Titus</hi> his ſon, who then exerciſed the office of Tribune of the Souldiers, and began in his tender years to give ſome proof of his valour; After this battle, the <hi>Brittains</hi> withdrew themſelves to the mouth of the River <hi>Thameſis,</hi> near the place where it falls into the Sea; and being skilful in the ſhallowes, and firm grounds, paſſed over in ſafety, when as the <hi>Romans</hi> that purſued them (not knowing the dangerous places) were oftentimes in great hazard; Some of the <hi>Germans</hi> that were moſt forward to adventure, by reaſon of their skill in ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, as ſoon as they had got to the further ſhore, were compaſſed about and killed by the Natives, and the reſt of the Roman Army that followed was much diſtreſted in the paſſage, and ſharply aſſailed at their comming on land, where began a bloody fight, in the which <hi>Togo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumius</hi> a <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Prince, one of <hi>Cunobelines</hi> Sons was ſlain, whoſe death did nothing abate the courage of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> but rather enflamed them with deſire of revenge; for the effecting whereof, they gathered together new Forces from divers parts of the Iſle. <hi>Plautius</hi> fearing the greatneſſe of their power, and being ſtraightned in a place of diſadvantage and danger, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded no further at that time, but fortifying only ſuch Townes as he had already taken, advertiſed <hi>Claudius</hi> of the doubtful ſtate of his Affairs.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was imployed in the other parts of the Iſle, where fortune ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay the Foundation of that greatneſſe, unto which he afterwards attained; for in ſhort ſpace he fought thirty times with the <hi>Brittains,</hi> overcoming two Warlike Nations, and tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fierce<note n="a" place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Countries of <hi>Somerſet, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>South-Hampton.</hi>

                           <hi>Claudius</hi> remitted the confiſcation of their goods, for which favour the <hi>Ilanders</hi> erected a Temple and an Altar unto him; honouring him as a God. Now the ſtates of the Country round about, being ſo weakned by the loſſe of their Neighbours, and their own civil diſſenſions, as they were unable to reſiſt the <hi>Roman</hi> power any longer, began to offer their ſubmiſſion, promiſing to obey and live peaceably under the Roman Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo by little and little the hither part of the Iſle was reduced into the form of a Province.</p>
                        <p>In honour of this Victyro, <hi>Claudius</hi> was divers times ſaluted by the name of Imperator, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Roman cuſtome, which permitted it but once for one expedition; The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo upon advertiſement of his ſucceſſe, decreed that he ſhould be called <hi>Brittanicus,</hi> and that his ſon ſhould have the ſame Title, as a ſurname proper and hereditary to the <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Family; <hi>Maſſilina</hi> his Wife, the monſter of her ſex, for impudency and laſciviouſneſſe, had the firſt place in council aſſigned her (as <hi>Sivia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Auguſtas</hi> ſometime had) and was alſo licenſed to ride in a Chariot at his return to <hi>Rome</hi> (which was the ſixth month after his departure thence, having continued but ſixteen dayes onely in this Iſle) he entred the City in triumph, performed with more then uſual ceremonies of ſtate, whereat certaine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of Provinces and baniſhed men were permitted to be preſent; On the top of his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace was placed a crown ſet with ſtems, and fore-parts of ſhips which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Corona Navalis,</hi> as a ſign of the conqueſt of the <hi>Ocean;</hi> divers Captains that had ſerved under him in <hi>Brittany,</hi> were honoured with Triumphal ornaments, yearly playes were appointed for him, and two Arches of Triumph adorned with Trophies, were erected, the one at <hi>Rome,</hi> the other at <hi>Geſſoriacum,</hi> where he embarked for <hi>Brittany,</hi> to remain to ſucceeding Ages: as perpetual records of his victory, and a work of ſuch merit to have ſubdued ſo ſmall a part of this Iſland.</p>
                        <p>About this time (as it may be probably conjectured) Chriſtian Religion being yet green, and of ſmall growth, began to caſt forth ſome ſmall ſparkes of her brightneſſe in the Iſle of <hi>Brittain;</hi> whether Chriſtians of <hi>Rome</hi> and other countries, then flying perſecution, reſorted for ſafety and quietneſſe, as to a place remote, and by reaſon of the Wars and Troubles there, not much ſubjected to inquiſition; whereas alſo divers <hi>Brittains</hi> remaining at <hi>Rome</hi> (where Chriſtianity then increaſed) either for Hoſtages,<note place="margin">The Hiſtory of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> part 1. fol. 35.</note> or detained as Priſoners, or haply for ſome private reſpects of profit and pleaſure, had opportunity and liberty to converſe with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Chriſtians, and to be by them inſtructed and confirmed in the Faith of Chriſt. The gate being now ſet open by this Author to diſcourſe of our Famous and Saintly <hi>Brittains,</hi> who even with the very firſt ſubmitted themſelves to the moſt heavenly and ſweet yoak of their divine Maſter and Lord eternal, Redeemer of Mankind, God and Man Chriſt Jeſus; I ſhall endeavour to make it evident by the Teſtimony of Learned and apporved Antiquities, to the great glory of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nation, that divers of them were the adopted ſons and children of their eternal Father, and the never-erring Catholick Church their Mother, within few years after the Death and Paſſion of our moſt bleſſed Redeemer.</p>

And yet certain it is that this St. <hi>Pudens</hi> was either but a very young child or not born when St. <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> and ſo young that a late Writer ſaith of him and <hi>Claudia,</hi> Pudens <hi>and</hi> Claudia <hi>were two young perſons</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> remembred them in his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which they ſay was in the laſt year of <hi>Nero,</hi> or without doubt not long before, 24 or 25 years after St. <hi>Peters</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Claudius</hi> his time by all our Accounts. And theſe Authors further ſay, they were ſo young that they were not in their judgements <hi>married untill the latter end of</hi> Trajans <hi>time or about the beginning of</hi> Domitian. And the Ancient Martyrology it ſelf is witneſſe, That when <hi>St. Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome, St. Pudens</hi> was not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian but baptized by him. Therefore it was not St. <hi>Pudens,</hi> then not born, or a young child and not Chriſtned but after, that did or could give the firſt entertainment in his Houſe to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or make his Houſe a Church for Chriſtians. Beſides, evident it is that this Saint <hi>Pudens</hi> was born in <hi>

                           <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Broug.</hi> fol. 59. 6.</note>To ſtrengthen this opinion, we may add that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſendeth to St. <hi>Timothy</hi> his Diſciple the ſalutations of <hi>Eubulus</hi> before all others; of which ſending the greetings of ſo few by name, it will be no eaſie ſearch to find out a better or more probable reaſon then this, that St. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> ſo neer and beloved a ſcholar of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> lodged uſually in this houſe: he alſo was there with his Maſter entertained by <hi>Eubulus</hi> the owner thereof, and by that Title of his Hoſpitality, obtained the firſt place in that ſalutation; otherwiſe no man will doubt but S. <hi>Linus</hi> Biſhop by calling, ſo honourable in the Church of Chriſt, ought and ſhould have been named before him; And that this familiar acquaintance between St. <hi>Timothy</hi> and theſe our holy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Brittains</hi> received original from their ancient entertainment of St. <hi>Timothy</hi> in their houſe in <hi>Rome</hi> many years before this their ſalutation, in the Epiſtle of <hi>St. Paul</hi> it is evident: for

                        <p>Whether St. <hi>Peter</hi> was here, in or about the beginning of the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and his Invaſion of this Nation, in the Fourth year of his Reign, as the common opinion of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries is, I dere not abſolutely determine, though divers together with <hi>Baronius</hi> incline to that opinion, and reaſons be not wanting to give probability to it. For if <hi>Pomponia Graecina,</hi> the wife of <hi>Aulus Plautius,</hi> the Emperors Lieut. in <hi>Brittain,</hi> was converted here to the Faith of Chriſt, this being before the perſecution, which they ſay <hi>Claudius</hi> raiſed againſt the Chriſtians the 49. year of Chriſt, <hi>Aulus Plantius</hi> then being returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> together with his Wife and Company to triumph there, therefore ſhe could not be converted here by any which they ſay fled hither from <hi>Rome</hi> in the beginning of that perſecution; and they can find no other Chriſtians here, except St. <hi>Peter</hi> or ſome other ſent by him, which they do not expreſſe (our late Writers) to perform that holy Office. Secondly, whereas it is manifeſt, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> after his coming to <hi>Rome, changed the darkneſſe of the Weſt into moſt bright ſplendour, and was commanded to illuminate the Weſt, the more dark or obſcure part of the World,</hi> it carrieth great probability that he began this work before his coming from the Eaſt to <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond time, after the Aſſumption of the B. Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and had enterprized it here in <hi>Brittain</hi> before thoſe dayes: for we read in our own ancient Authors (eſpecially the Manuſcript-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) that about the 49. year of Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> did take the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which muſt needs be to make it true after his return to <hi>Rome</hi> out of ſome of theſe Weſt parts. Thirdly, We find in the <hi>French</hi> Annals, cited by <hi>Gulielmus Eiſengrenius,</hi> divers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops conſecrated by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in this time for our neighbouring Country of <hi>France;</hi> as namely, St. <hi>Maximinus</hi> or <hi>Maximus</hi> at <hi>Aquens</hi> or <hi>Aix,</hi> and St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> at <hi>Marſiles,</hi> in the year of Chriſt 46. <hi>St. Martial</hi> at <hi>Limoges,</hi> and <hi>St. Julian</hi> at <hi>Maus</hi> in the ſame year, <hi>St. Paulus Sergius</hi> at <hi>Narbon</hi> in the year 48. when <hi>St. Paul</hi> the Apoſtle was not come into theſe parts to place him there.</p>
                        <p>And to make this more credible, If we follow that Author with his Antiquities, <hi>St. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at <hi>Mentz</hi> and our Countryman St. <hi>Manſuetus</hi> at <hi>Toul</hi> in <hi>Loraine,</hi> who in this opinion may be thought to be left there by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt return from <hi>Brittain</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> being in his way from hence thither; and this the rather becauſe many Hiſtorians teſtifie, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained there by St. <hi>Peter:</hi> and yet not any one remembreth any place from whence he was directed thither, but only affirm, as he expoundth them, that he was conſecrated Biſhop of that place by St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 49. year of Chriſt. And this more probable, becauſe after this 49. year of Chriſt the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians, which take pains to ſet down exactly the very year, wherein their firſt Apoſtles and Biſhops were ordained unto them, by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, do not ſet down the year wherein any one after this time was Conſecrated, until the 54 of the Nativity of Chriſt, by and before ſuch time S. <hi>Peter</hi> was come unto <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and the Eaſtern parts, the ſecond time into theſe Weſtern Nations of the world, when he both was, and ſtayed long time in this our <hi>Brittain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this giveth light unto us, that about this year of Chriſt 54. S. <hi>Peter</hi> came hither to ſtay long time in <hi>Brittain;</hi> for in this year, as the French Antiquaries write, S. <hi>Peter</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated many Biſhops in <hi>France,</hi> in his way from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Brittain;</hi> in this year, as they write he ordained S. <hi>Sabinianus,</hi> or <hi>Sabinus one of the</hi> 72 <hi>Diſciples primate of all</hi> France, <hi>Archbiſhop of Sens;</hi> in which year alſo he Conſecrated (as theſe Authors ſay) many other Biſhops in <hi>France,</hi> as St. <hi>Nathaniell</hi> ſpoken of in the Goſpell: and by ſome named <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſianus,</hi> S. <hi>Amator,</hi> S. <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> S. <hi>Fronto</hi> and others; among which the rather to induce us to think that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was then in <hi>France,</hi> this <hi>S. Fronto</hi> then Conſecrated Biſhop by <hi>S. Peter,</hi> was a Frenchman born, as many Authorities prove unto us: and ſo moſt likely to be Conſecrated in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and the Authority of <hi>S. Simeon</hi> Metaphraſtes (who was as <hi>Godwyn</hi> calls him, <hi>An Author without exception</hi>) who of all others doth moſt particularly ſet down the travailes of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> will bring him into <hi>Brittain</hi> about this time, the ſecond time as it ſeemeth of his being here; for bringing him to <hi>Rome</hi> as others do, in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> he addeth

Paul</hi> came, although as a priſoner, firſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Apoſtle thither, or any other Weſtern Nation; For as it is proved before, S. <hi>Peter</hi> going up to <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> by revelation, at the death of the bleſſed Virgin, did ſtay but a ſhort time there, and in the Eaſtern parts in that Journey; but the charge of the Weſtern world being more particularly committed unto him before, he returned unto it, to diſcharge his duty here, and although <hi>Metaphraſtes</hi> bringeth him back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he ſpeaketh of no ſtay, he made there at his time; but preſently bringeth him into <hi>Brittain.</hi>

Oſtorius</hi> his ſon was Crowned with an Oaken Garland, as an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reward for ſaving a Roman Citizen; Now by the ſlaughter of the <hi>Icenians,</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Brittains</hi> (who ſtood upon doubtful termes, as wavering between War and peace) were well quieted, and <hi>Oſtorius</hi> led his Army againſt the<note n="a" place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured.</note> 
                           <hi>Caugi,</hi> whoſe Countrey he ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and waſted, whilſt the inhabitants doth not come into the Field, but privately, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed ſuch as they found ſtragling behind the Roman Army, which was now come near to the Sea Coaſt that looks towards <hi>Ireland;</hi> when as certain tumults ſtirred among the <hi>Brittains,</hi> brought back the General, who thought it beſt not to enter into any new action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had made all ſure in thoſe parts; howbeit upon his coming thither ſome few of the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> (that firſt began to take Arms) being taken in and put to death, the reſidue were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and the Country quieted. For the General wiſely conſidering that in ſuch caſes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſometimes prevaileth, where Force and Rigour cannot, did ſeek to win favour of the <hi>Brittains</hi> by courteous uſage of ſuch as either fled unto him for protection or elſe by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of War fell into his Hands; ſometimes pardoning them, ſometimes rewarding them, and ſometimes uſing them in ſervice againſt their own Nation, as he did <hi>Cogidunus</hi> a <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Prince,<note place="margin">The ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Southwales.</hi>
                           </note> upon whom he had beſtowed certain Cities in free gift, according to an ancient cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who uſed even Kings themſelves for inſtruments of bondage. But the <hi>Silures</hi> could neither by cruelty, nor fair means be held in, ſo as the General ſaw
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61256:59"/> there was no way to keep them under but with a Gariſon of Legionary Souldeirs; and to that end, the <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Camalodunum</hi> (conſiſting of a ſtrong Company of old Souldiers) was brought into the ſubdued Country to defend it againſt ſuch as ſhould rebell, and to make the Confederates more willing to live in obedience.</p>
                        <p>This done, the Army marched againſt the <hi>Silures,</hi> who beſides their natural boldneſſe, relied much upon the ſtrength of <hi>Caracticus</hi> their Leader; a man that had waded through great dangers, and had been fortunate in many adventures, having gotten thereby ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as he was preferred before all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Captains. But as in policy and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Country, he had an advantage of the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſo perceiving himſelf to be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually matched in ſtrength, he removed the War to the<note n="a" place="margin">The ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Northwales.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Ordovices,</hi> who entering into the action with him (as fearing alone the Roman power) reſolved jointly to hazard the chance of War; and hereupon they prepared for battle, having choſen a place very commodious for themſelves, and diſadvantageable to their Enemies; then they went to the top of an Hill, and where they found an eaſie paſſage up, they ſtopped the way with heaps of ſtones in manner of a Rampire; not far off ran a River with an uncertain ford, where upon the bank, a company of the beſt Souldiers were placed, for a defence in the foreward; the Leaders went about exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging the common Souldiers, uſing ſuch perſwaſions as may beſt fit their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and the preſent occaſion; and <hi>Caracticus</hi> himſelf poſting up and down, proteſted that that day, and that battle, ſhould be either the beginning of the recovery of their Liberty, or of perpetual Servitude. Then he called upon the names of his Anceſtors, that had chaſed <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> the Dictator out of the Iſland, and had delivered them from Hatches and Tributes, and had protected their Wives and Children from ſhame and violence; while he uttered theſe or the like ſpeeches, the people round about him made a noyſe, and every man ſware, according to the Religion of his Country, that neither the Enemies Weapons, nor their own Wounds ſhould make them give over; that chearful cry terrified and aſtoniſhed the Roman General; and the rather, when he conſidered how he was couped in, having the river beneath him, the Fort before him, the high Hills hanging over it, and all things on every ſide threatning dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and deſtruction to the Aſſailers: howbeit his fellow Souldiers demanded the battle, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That there was no thing which Valour could not overcome,</hi> uſing the like ſpeeches, added courage to the reſt.</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>Oſtorius</hi> having viewed the places of difficulty led his Souldiers (being hot or eager of the Fight) unto the further ſide of the river, and from thence to the Rampire, where while they fought with their Darts, they had the firſt, but having broken down the rude compacted heap of ſtones with a <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> and both Armies coming to handy ſtroaks upon equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the <hi>Brittains</hi> turned their backs, and ran to the Hill top, the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing them, both with their light and heavy armed Souldiers, the one aſſailing with Darts, the other (as they marched thick together) breaking the ranks, and beating down the Natives, who had neither Head piece, nor Armour to defend themſelves; ſo that being hedged in between the <hi>Legionary</hi> Souldiers, and the <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> the greateſt part of them was ſlain in the place.</p>
                        <p>At this aſſault <hi>Caracticus</hi> his Wife and Daughter were taken priſoners, and his Brethren yielded to the Enemies, but himſelf driven to extremity, ſcaped by Flight into the Country of the <hi>Brigants,</hi> hoping to receive ſome aid of <hi>Cartiſmandua</hi> the Soveraigne Lady there; But as it falleth out commonly with men in adverſity, to be forſaken and left ſuccourleſſe, ſo inſtead of finding the relief which he expected, he fell into the danger which he little doubted: for <hi>Cartiſmandua</hi> either fearing her own eſtate; or thinking to winne favour of the Conqueror (as Princes oftentimes make uſe of one anothers miſ fortunes, to ſerve their own turnes) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him in priſon a while, and afterward delivered him to <hi>Odorius,</hi> who was exceeding glad he had gotten him, and forthwith ſent him to <hi>Rome,</hi> as a prize of great worth, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruit of nine years ſervice in the Wars.</p>
                        <p>The report of <hi>Caracticus</hi> misfortune was ſoon ſpread throughout the Iſles and Provinces adjoyning; for his name was renowned in moſt parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and each man deſired to ſee him, who had ſo long time withſtood, and continued that power, which held all the world in awe and obedience; The City of <hi>Rome</hi> for many dayes together was filled only with the talk of him, and expectation of his coming: and the Emperour himſelf as a Conquerour, by extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his own worthineſſe, covertly added more glory to the Conquered; the people aſſemble together, as it were to ſee ſome notable and rare ſpectacle; the Emperours guard in Arms were orderly placed in the Field, before the Camp; after this preparation made, the Priſoners and Trophies were preſented in this manner. Firſt, The Vaſſals of <hi>Caracticus</hi> going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, bowed their bodies to the people as they paſſed, and ſeemed by their Ruefull Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to diſcover their fear; the Caparaſons, Chaines, and other ſpoiles, taken in the War, were carried after them; then <hi>Caracticus,</hi> his Brethren, Wife and Daughters followed. And laſt of all came <hi>Caracticus</hi> himſelf; his body was naked for the moſt part, and painted with the figures of divers Beaſts; he wore a Chain of Iron about his Neck, and another about his Middle, the Hair of his head hanging down in long Locks (curled by nature) covered his back and ſhoulders, and the Hair of his upper lip, being parted on both ſides, lay upon his breaſt, the reſt of his body was ſhaven all over; neither was his behaviour leſſe noted then the ſtrangeneſſe of his habit; for he neither hung down his head, nor craved mercy (as did the reſt) but went on boldly with a ſettled and ſtern Countenance, till he came before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

                           <hi>CARACTIC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> his Speech.</head>
                        <p>IF either my vertues in proſperity had been anſwerable to the greatneſſe of my eſtate, or the ſucceſſe of my late attempts to the reſolution of my mind, I might have come to this City, to have been entertained rather as a Friend, then as a Captive to be gazed upon; For it would have been no diſgrace for the <hi>Romans</hi> to have admitted me into ſociety with them, a man Royally Deſcended, and a Commander of many Warlike Nations. But what cloud ſoever fortune hath caſt over my eſtate ſhe is not able to take from me thoſe things which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and nature have given me (that is) the dignity of my Birth, and the courage of my mind which never failed me: I know it is a cuſtome among you, to make your <hi>Triumphs</hi> the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of other mens miſeries; and in this my calamity, as in a mirrour you do behold your own glory; yet know, that I was ſometimes a Prince furniſhed with ſtrength of Men, and ability of War; and what marvell is it that I have now loſt them, ſince your own experience hath taught you, that the events of War are variable and uncertain? I thought that the deep waters which like a wall incloſe us (whom the Heavens ſeem to have placed far off in another world by it ſelf) might have been a ſufficient defence for us againſt Forrain Invaſion; but I ſee now that your deſire of Soveraignity admits no limitation, ſince neither the danger of an unknown Sea, nor the diſtance of place, can any longer warrant our ſafety and liberty: if you will needs command the whole world, then muſt all men become your Vaſſals, and live under a forced obedience; For mine own part, ſo long as I was able, I made reſiſtance, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſubmit my Neck to a Forrain Yoak. The Law of natural reaſon alloweth every man to defend himſelf being aſſailed, and to withſtand force, to which force had I yielded at the firſt, thy Glory and my Miſhap had not been ſo renowned, but both of them would ſoon have been forgotten; Fortune hath done her worſt, and we have now nothing left us but our lives, which if thou ſpare (having power to ſpill) thou ſhalt do that which beſt beſeemeth a great Mind, and a Noble Nature.</p>
                        <p>The Emperour hearing his Speech, and wondering to ſee ſuch boldneſſe and conſtancy of a mind in dejected eſtate, pardoned both him and the reſt of his company, commanding them to be unbound, and ſo diſmiſſed them.</p>
                        <p>For many daves together <hi>Caracticus</hi> his fortune miniſtred matter of diſcourſe to the Lords of the Senate who affirmed the ſpectacle of his Captivity to be no leſſe honourable then that of <hi>Syphax</hi> the <hi>Numidian</hi> King, over whom <hi>P. Scipio</hi> triumphed, or that of <hi>Perſes,</hi> whom <hi>P. Aemilius</hi> vanquiſhed, or of any other Kings that had in former times been taken in War, and ſhewed to the people the publick honours of triumph were decreed for <hi>Oſtorius,</hi> whoſe fortunes being now at the higheſt, began afterwards to decline by reaſon that either <hi>Caracticus,</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his valour being removed, he ſuppoſed he had made a full conqueſt, and therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſervice more careleſly, or elſe for that the reſidue of the <hi>Brittaines</hi> having compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the misfortune of ſo mighty a Prince, and being eager of revenge, renewed the War; for they aſſailed the <hi>Legionary Cohorts,</hi> which were left behind to build Fortreſſes in the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures</hi> Country, killed the Camp Maſter, and eight <hi>Centurions,</hi> beſides ſome of the forewardeſt Souldiers, and they had put all the reſt to the ſword, if ſpeedy reſcue had not come from the Villages and Forts adjoyning; divers other ſallies they made as time and place gave them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, prevailing ſometimes by ſtrength, ſometimes by policy, and ſometimes by chance; the principal motive that induced the reſt to take Armes, was the example of the <hi>Silures,</hi> who were moſt reſolutely bent, as being exaſperated by reaſon of a ſpeech that the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had uſed, which was, that he would root out the name of the <hi>Silures,</hi> as the <hi>Sicambrians</hi> had been in former time; this made them bold and deſperate to adventure as men knowing their deſtiny before hand; many skirmiſhes they had in ſurpriſing the ſcattered Troops of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, and oftentimes with good ſucceſſe, in taking rich Booties and Priſoners, and diſtributing the ſpoiles among their Neighbours, by which means they drew them alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt; In the mean time <hi>Oſtorius</hi> wearied with care and travel, ended his Life.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor being advertiſed of the death of <hi>Oſtorius,</hi> ſent <hi>Aulus Didius</hi> to take charge of the Army in <hi>Brittain,</hi> where notwithſtanding all the haſte he made, he found all out of Frame; <hi>Manlius Valens</hi> with his Legion having encountred the <hi>Brittains</hi> with ill ſucceſſe, which by report of the Ilanders, was made greater then indeed it was, to terrifie the new Governor, who alſo made uſe of the ſame policy to ſerve his own turn; for by encreaſing the Fame of that which he heard reported, he ſuppoſed either to win greater praiſe if he prevailed, or to purchaſe a more favourable Cenſure of his actions if he miſcarriede. The <hi>Silures</hi> had made many roads into the ſubdued Country, waſting and ſpoiling round about, when <hi>Didius</hi> the Lieutenant upon his firſt arrival entering into the Field, reſtrained their outrage, and for a while kept them in ſome awe.</p>
                        <p>After <hi>Caracticus</hi> was taken, <hi>Venutius</hi> a Prince faithfull to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and protected by them (ſo long as <hi>Cartiſmandua</hi> his wife and he agreed together,) upon private diſcontentment
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61256:60"/> began a new rebellion; For <hi>Cartiſmandua</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpecially favoured for the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Cataracticus</hi>) abounding now in peace, wealth and plenty, (which are commonly the Nurſes of licentious living) fell in love with <hi>Velocatus</hi> one of her husbands ſervants, and forgetting in the end her own honour, preferred him before <hi>Venutius,</hi> who being deeply tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſuch an open injury and diſgrace, raiſed a power to expell her and her Paramour out of the Kingdome. The War ſeemed at the firſt to have been maintained between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their private followers onely till <hi>Cartiſmandua</hi> by pollicy, had taken <hi>Venutius</hi> his brother and certain of his kinſmen, and then the Inhabitants round about fearing the event, and diſdaining to be brought under the ſervile yoak of a Woman, declared themſelves for <hi>Venutius,</hi> and with a choice number of youthful and well experienced Souldiers invaded the Country: whereof <hi>Didius</hi> having timely intelligence, ſent certain Cohorts to encounter them. Hereupon iſſued a ſharp Conflict; the Succeſſe whereof was much doubted in the beginning, but in the end the <hi>Romans</hi> prevailed. The like Fortune alſo had <hi>Caeſius Naſica</hi> with his Legion; for <hi>Didius</hi> himſelf as a man ſtricken in years and fitter to direct then execute, uſed for the moſt part the Miniſtery of other men, keeping that which his Predeceſſors had gotten, and building onely ſome few Caſtles and Places of Defence within the Land, to win thereby a Fame of augmenting the Office.</p>
                        <p>The year following, <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor by the treachery of <hi>Agrippina</hi> his wife, who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed to prevent <hi>Brittanicus,</hi> and to prefer her own Son <hi>Nero</hi> to the Empire, died of poyſon, leaving to poſterity no greater Fame of any thing by him attempted during his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, then of his fortunate Expedition into <hi>Brittany.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>This was the ſtate of the Affairs in <hi>Brittain</hi> when <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor died, leaving the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy to <hi>Nero</hi> his adopted Son who (after his firſt five years ſpent) being given over to all kind of Vice, neglected the Government both at home and abroad, not daring to enter into any military Action. And it was thought that he would have revoked the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my out of <hi>Brittain,</hi> if very ſhame in detracting from his Fathers glory, and loſing that which he had won, had not withheld him.</p>
                        <p>About that time <hi>Veranius</hi> was Governour in <hi>Brittain,</hi> where the ſhortneſſe of his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſuffered him not to effect any great matter; for he died in the firſt year of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then was the Province aſſigned to <hi>Suetonius Paulinus,</hi> one of the moſt famous Men of that Age for military Affairs. His good Succeſſe at his firſt entrance, in ſubduing Nations and eſtabliſhing Gariſons (where need required) made him bold to aſſail the Iſle of<note n="a" place="margin">Anglicey.</note> 
                           <hi>Mona</hi> (lying in the Weſt part of <hi>Brittain</hi>) as having been a common receptacle for Fugitives du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War: in his paſſage thither he left the Country behind him as he marched unfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in divers places, laying it thereby open to all opportunites of Annoyance. At his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the Natives meanly armed, ſtanding upon the ſhore, made ſhew of their purpoſe to Reſiſt. The Women in mourning Attire, their hair about their ears, ſhaking burning fire-brands like Furies of Hell, ran up and down, and the <hi>Druids</hi> lifting up their hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heavens, filled the Air with cries and curſings. Theſe <hi>Druids</hi> (of whom mention is formerly made) were certain Prieſts had in great Reverence by the <hi>Brittains;</hi> they kepe their reſidence for the moſt part in ſhady and dark Groves (as fitteſt places for devotion.) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Trees they moſt eſteemed the Oak, as hallowed, and without the which they could not perform their ſuperſtitious Rites. Their Sacrifices were both private and publick; they inſtructed the youth of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and decided Controverſies Civil and Criminal: if any man refuſed to ſtand to their award, he was forbidden to be preſent at their Sacrifices, which was accounted the greateſt puniſhment that might be; for thereby he was reputed a notorious Offender, exempt from the ordinary protection of the Laws, uncapable of any preferment, and all men would fly his company.</p>
                        <p>The ſtrange behaviour of theſe religious or rather irrelegious Prieſts, and the out-cries of the people of <hi>Mona,</hi> ſo amazed the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, that like men inchanted, they ſtood ſtill without motion, till the Captain ſpake unto them and encouraged them to adventure, not fearing a flock of ſilly women or frantick people, and then boldly giving the Charge, he ſoon diſordered and diſperſed them, making himſelf Maſter of the Field; which done, the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers entered the Towns and placed Garriſons there, felling the Woods which the Inhabitants ſuperſtitiouſly reputed holy by reaſon of the Altars whereupon they ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the blood of Captives, and propheſied of the Succeſſe of their own Affairs by viewing the entrails of men whom they had killed.</p>

                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Praſutagus</hi> Prince of the <hi>Icenians,</hi> a Man renowned for his Riches, did by his laſt Will make the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor his Heir (joyntly with two of his Daughters,) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that thereby his Principality and Family ſhould have been maintain'd in good Eſtate, and protected from Violence after his death: all which fell out contrary to his hopes; for his Kingdome was made a prey to the Souldiers: <hi>Voadica</hi> his Wife whipped, his Daughters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured, ſuch as were of the Family made ſlaves, and the wealthieſt Men of his Country, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by open force or ſurmiſed pretences, deprived of their goods and diſpoſſeſſed of their inheritance; beſides that <hi>Seneca</hi> one of <hi>Nero</hi> his Counſellors, having forced divers of the better ſort of the <hi>Brittains</hi> to take great Sums of Mony of him upon Uſury, did then for his private gain, exact the payment of the Principal upon a ſudden, to the utter undoing of his Debtors; and <hi>Decianus Catus</hi> the Procurator in <hi>Brittany,</hi> renewed the Confiſcation of their Goods, which <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor had pardoned. The Souldiers placed in the Colony at <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> had thruſt the owners and ancient Inhabitants out of their Houſes, terming them ſlaves and drudges, and abuſing them in all ſhameful manner. The Temple erected in honour of <hi>Claudius</hi> was an eye-ſore and a continual burning unto them, while the Prieſts <hi>Auguſtales</hi> that attended there, waſted the Wealth of the Inhabitants, under the pretext of Religion. To theſe common grievances of the afflicted people, the preſent occaſion ſeemed to offer means of redreſſe while the <hi>Roman</hi> General was making War in <hi>Mona:</hi> whereupon they reſolved to take Arms, inciting the <hi>Trinobants</hi> and other Nations (that were wholly brought under ſubjection) to doe the like. Then they began to diſcourſe of their miſeries of bondage, to lay their injuries together, aggravating them by their own conſtructions, and complaining that their patience had profited them nothing, but to draw heavy burdens upon them as men that would gently bear. That whereas in former times they had only one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, now there was two thruſt upon them; the Lieutenant to ſuck their blood, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator their ſubſtance; whoſe diſagreement was the vexation of the ſubject, and agreement utter undoing; while the one burdened them with Souldiers and Captains, the other with wrongs and indignities. That the luſt and covetouſneſſe of theſe their Enemies laid hold upon all perſons without exception; that though in the field he that ſpoileth be commonly the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yet themſelves were by Cowards and Weaklings (for the moſt part) diſpoſſeſſed of their Houſes, bereft of their Children, enjoyned to yield Souldiers for other mens behoof, as though they were ſuch a kind of people as knew how to doe any thing elſe ſave onely to die for their Country. For otherwiſe there was but a handful of Souldiers come over, if they did but reckon their own number, conſidering withall that <hi>Germany</hi> had already ſhaken off the yoak, having no Ocean-Sea, but a River to defend it. That the cauſes then moving them to take Arms were juſt and honourable; namely, to recover their liberty, and to defend their Parents, Wives, Children and Country; whereas the <hi>Romans</hi> had nothing to provoke them to war but their own covetouſneſſe and wanton luſt, and were likely enough to depart (as <hi>Julius Cæſar</hi> had done) if themſelves would imitate the vertues of their Progenitors, and not be diſmaid with the doubtful event of one skirmiſh or two, ſeeing that men in miſery have commonly more courage (then at other times) and more conſtancy to continue: and now the Heavens themſelves ſeemed to pity their poor eſtate, by ſending the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour out of the way, and confining the Army (as it were) into another Iland, by which means opportunity of revenge and hope of liberty was offered: and finally, that being Aſſembled to adviſe and deliberate together, they had obtained the hardeſt point in an action of that nature; wherein it were more dangerous to be taken conſulting then doing; with theſe and the like Speeches they ſtirred up one another, each man laying his own particular grievances, and adding them to the common cauſe.</p>
                        <p>About this time divers prodigious Signs were noted to portend the ſubverſion of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                           <pb n="112" facs="tcp:61256:64"/> Colony; as namely, an Image of victory falling down, reverſed at <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> ſtrange noyſes ſounding in the Air, ſtrange apparitions ſeen in the Sea, the Ocean bloody in ſhew, and the prints of mens bodies on the Sands; diverſe conſtructions were made of theſe things as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous, whether that they proceeded of ſome natural cauſes (though not alwaies obſerved) or elſe that they do neceſſarily forgoe the ruine and change of great ſtates: howbeit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in ſuch caſes mens minds do miſgive them, while they frame the future event of things anſwerable to their own fearful imaginations, and great alterations falling out ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like accidents, they ſuperſtitiouſly ſuppoſe them to be alwaies the certaine forerunners of deſtruction; the apprehenſion of theſe things at the firſt ſtruck the <hi>Romans</hi> with great fear, by reaſon of the abſence of their General, and thereupon they required the aid of <hi>Catus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus</hi> the<note n="a" place="margin">Receiver of the revenues of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</note> Procurator, who ſent a ſmall company badly armed, to re-enforce the Gariſon. The old Souldiers that had been left within the Town (although few in number) yet truſting to the <hi>Frenchiſe</hi> of the Temple, and not doubting the ſecret conſpiracies of their confederates, were in a manner careleſſe, as in times of peace, following their pleaſures, and making no proviſion for defence; The <hi>Brittains</hi> having in the mean time taken Armes under the conduct of <hi>Voadica,</hi> a Lady of the blood of their Kings (for in matter of Government they made no difference of Sex) and being informed of the ſtate of the Colony, determined, firſt to aſſaile the Towns and Forts in their paſſage thither, which they attempted accordingly, and with no great difficulty ſurpriſed the greateſt number of them.</p>
                        <p>The good ſucceſſe the <hi>Brittains</hi> had in taking in ſome places of defence as they marched forward, made them deſirous and adventerous to invade the Colony it ſelf; and <hi>Voadica</hi> as their Leader, being a Woman of great Spirit, and comely Perſonage (apparaled in a looſe Gown of divers colours, with a Golden Chain about her Neck, and a light Spear in her hand ſtanding upon a heap of Turfes, the better to be ſeen (her Daughters on each ſide of her) with a ſhrill voice, uttered theſe or the like words.</p>

                        <p>IT is no new cuſtome for the <hi>Brittains</hi> to make War under the leading of a Woman, Enobled by their Birth and Diſcent; the examples of former times can well witneſſe the experience thereof; howbeit at this preſent, I will diſclaim all Titles of Dignity, and Prerogatives of blood: and what difference ſoever there is in our Eſtates, yet ſhall our Fortune in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be indifferent, and common to us both; it ſhall not need to repeat that, which you all know but too well, namely, what miſeries we have endured under the Tyranny of this proud Nation; you have had the triall both of Liberty and Bondage, and I doubt not but you find now how much the one is to be preferred before the other, and howſoever ſome of you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore for private reſpects have inclined to the Roman Governours, as Favourers of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Sovereignty; yet I ſuppoſe you will now confeſſe with me, that freedome in a poor Eſtate, is better then Golden Fetters: for what abuſe can there be named ſo vile, or indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſo diſgraceful, that hath not been offered us, without reſpect of Degree, Age or Sex; we Till our ground and ſweat for other Men that reap the ſweat of our Travels; the wealth that we gather together to maintain our ſelves, and our Families, is by other men waſtfully and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly miſpent; we have nothing our own, but what they leave us; and nothing left us, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and vexation: our bodies and eſtates being conſumed to ſatisfie their ambition and covetouſneſſe; we have not ſo much as our heads toll-free ſo narrowly we are ſifted, from the higheſt to the loweſt; Other ſubdued Nations are yet by death free from Bondage, but we even after death ſeem to live ſtill in Thraldome, while we are inforced to pay Tribute, as well for the dead as the living; what? are we a Nation ſo contemptible, that we can ſerve to no other uſe then to be ſlaves, or ſo unhappy that death it ſelf cannot acquit us from being miſerable? How long ſhall we give way to our own wrongs? ſhall we hope for reformation of theſe abuſes? nay we have hoped too long, and by patient bearing of one injury, we have drawn on another; why ſhould we not rather ſeek to redreſſe them? for if we enter into due conſideration of our ſelves, what are the <hi>Romans</hi> more then we? our bodies are as ſtrong as theirs, our numbers greater; we have agility of body (our women no leſſe then our men) to run, to leap, to ſwim, and to perform all warlike exerciſes; for which indeed we are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more fit, then for the ſpade, plough, or handy-crafts; and howſoever the <hi>Romans</hi> may ſeem fortunate by the folly or weakneſſe of other Nations, yet are they not comparable to us, whom nature hath framed to endure, Hunger, Cold, and Labour, and to be content with things neceſſary only; for to us every herb and root is meat; each river and ſpring yieldeth us drink, while we ſeek no further then to appeaſe hunger and quench thirſt; each tree ſerves for ſhelter againſt ſtormes in winter, and for ſhadow againſt the parching heat of Summer; we need no other beds then Earth, nor coverings then the Heavens, whereas they muſt have their joints ſuppled with hot Baths, ſweet Oyntments, and ſoft Couches, and their bodies pampered with Wine, dainty fair, and all kind of effeminate niceneſſe and delicacy; theſe

Beſides all this, the cauſe of our War is juſt, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine powers (that favour juſtice) have made our firſt attempt proſperous; and me thinketh that the neceſſity of our Caſe were able even to make Cowards valiant: your Anceſtors could make Head againſt <hi>Julius Cæſar,</hi> and the Emperors <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Claudius.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> have lately freed themſelves by that memorable overthrow of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions under the Conduct of <hi>Quintilius Varus;</hi> And ſhall not we (who ſcorn to be reputed Inferiour to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in Valour) be confident in our own ſtrength and boldly adventure? conſidering that if we prevail, we recover our loſt liberty; if we be forced to retire, we have Woods, Hills and Mariſhes for our Refuge; and if we die, we do but ſell thoſe lives with Honour, which we cannot poſſeſſe with Safety.

Then he pitched in a place that had a narrow entrance with a thick Wood for a Defence behind him, and a fair wide plain before his Camp. The Legionary Souldiers were marſhalled together in thick ranks, the light Harneſſed encloſing them about, and the Horſemen making wings on both ſides; <hi>Poenius Poſthumus</hi> the Camp-Maſter of the ſecond Legion, was appointed to lead the fore-ward, but he contemptuouſly refuſed the charge.

                        <p>Then <hi>Suetonius</hi> having gathered together his ſcattered Troops, certaine Legionary Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Cohorts of Auxiliares were ſent him out of <hi>Germany</hi> to re-enforce the Gariſons and to make an end of the War, ſo of the <hi>Brittains</hi> that either openly reſiſted, or elſe ſtood doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affected were put to the ſword; and ſome that eſcaped the ſword, died of Famine for lack of Corn (a calamity incident to them, as to people given rather to War then to Husbandry) the reſt found means to relieve themſelves by the <hi>Romans</hi> proviſions; and though ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were now and then made for a Treaty of peace, yet the <hi>Brittains</hi> could not very readily hearken thereunto by reaſon they much doubted their ſafety, as imagining that their guiltineſs of rebellion had excluded them from all hope of pardon, and they feared alſo the private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61256:65"/> of the Lieutenant, who (though otherwiſe a ſingular man) yet ſeemed to ſhew too much haughty and hard dealing towards them that yielded themſelves, and in ſome ſort under the pretext of the publick ſervice to revenge his own injuries.</p>
                        <p>Beſides <hi>Julius Claſſianus</hi> (which was ſent to ſucceed <hi>Catus</hi>) being at variance with <hi>Suetonius,</hi> had given out that a Lieutenant was coming, and that he was ſuch a one as being void of malice or the pride of a Conquerour, would be ready to receive into favour all ſuch as would yield themſelves. He wrote Letters alſo to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſignifying to the Senate that they ſhould look for no end of the War in <hi>Brittain,</hi> ſo long as <hi>Suetonius</hi> continued the government there; and that the ill ſucceſſe which he had in the ſervice, was to be attributed to his own ill carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of himſelf, and the good to the fortune of the Commonwealth. Hereupon <hi>Nero</hi> ſent <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licletus</hi> a Libertine into <hi>Brittany</hi> to examine and report the ſtate of the Affairs there, and to enterpoſe his Authority, as a mean to reconcile the Lieutenant and the Procurator; and to win the <hi>Brittains</hi> to embrace peace. At his landing in the Ile the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to fear and reverence him, and the cauſes of his coming were diverſly reported at the firſt. But the <hi>Brittains</hi> derided him; for as men being born free they knew not till that time the power of the <hi>Libertines</hi> (men made free) but rather marvelled that a Captain and an Army which had atchieved ſo great an enterprize, could be brought to obey and yield an account of their actions to a baſe bond-ſlave (as they termed him.)</p>
                        <p>Theſe things howſoever they were cenſured by others, yet they were reported to <hi>Nero</hi> in ſuch manner as the reporters thought might beſt content him; And <hi>Suetonius</hi> after the loſſe of ſome of his ſhipping, was commanded, the War being not yet finiſhed, to deliver up his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Petronius Turpilianus,</hi> who had but even a little before given up his Counſelſhip.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Turpilianus</hi> was a man of a ſoft ſpirit, and being a ſtranger to the <hi>Brittains</hi> faults; was more tractable and ready to remit them, by which means having compoſed his former troubles, he delivered up his charge to <hi>Tribellius Maximus,</hi> whoſe unfitneſſe for action, and want of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in military matters, gave the more boldneſſe to the <hi>Brittains</hi> that began now to diſcover the defects of the Governours, having learned both to flatter and diſſemble; in confirming themſelves to the preſent time and occaſion for their advantage, and for the moſt part yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to thoſe pleaſures which ſecurity uſeth to endanger even in minds well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Nature. For <hi>Trebellius,</hi> beſides his inſufficiency, abuſed the authority of his place to enrich himſelf by polling the common Souldiers, and <hi>Roſcuis Caelius</hi> Lieutenant to the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Legion, whetted them on againſt him, as againſt an ancient Enemy; ſo that in the end they brake out into hainous terms, the one objecting matter of crime againſt the other. <hi>Trebellius</hi> charged <hi>Caelius</hi> with factious behaviour, <hi>Caelius</hi> again <hi>Trebellius</hi> with beggering the Legions, and the diſcord between them grew ſo far, that <hi>Trebellius</hi> being deſpiſed as well by the Hides as the Legions (both of them ſorting themſelves to <hi>Caelius</hi> his ſide) was in great fear of his life, the danger whereof he ſought to prevent, rather by flying away, then by executing any exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary juſtice upon offenders; in the mean time the Souldiers neglecting the ancient diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of War fell to Mutiny and all kind of Riot, as men that had rather be doing ill, then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing. Afterwards <hi>Trebellius</hi> taking again his former place as it were by capitulation, ſeemed to govern onely at the diſcretion of the Souldiers, who finding his weakneſſe and want of judgement to uſe his Authority, took upon them to do what they liſted; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo the Lieutenant himſelf ſeemed contented, as being now given over altogether to a ſloathful kind of life (terming it peace and quietneſſe) for which the death of <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, and the civil diſcord at that time between <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> contending for the Soveraignty miniſtred ſome colour of excuſe.</p>
                        <p>Not long before this time the fourteenth Legion (famous for many great attempts, and growing now more inſolent then the reſt) was revoked out of the Iſle to have been ſent to the ſtreights about the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, though afterwards upon intelligence of the revolt in <hi>Gallia, Spain,</hi> (when <hi>Julius Vindex</hi> took Armes againſt <hi>Nero</hi>) it was retained about the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for a ſafeguard to thoſe parts; in the turbulent times that enſued <hi>Nero</hi>'s death; it took part with <hi>Otho</hi> againſt <hi>Vitellius</hi> at the battle near <hi>Bebriacum,</hi> where <hi>Otho</hi> was overthrown, and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> after the victory ſuſpecting the Souldiers of that Legion (as knowing their great ſtomachs and ill affection towards him) thought it expedient to joyn to them the<note n="a" place="margin">Bands of <hi>Hollanders.</hi>

                           <hi>Ordovices</hi> a little before he had landed, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cut in pieces a Troop of Horſemen that lay in their borders: upon which Attempt the Country being awaked as deſirous of war, allowed the example, and ſome then ſtaid to ſee how the new Lieutenant would take it. <hi>Agricola</hi> in the mean time, although the Summer was ſpent and the Bands lay diſperſed in the Province, his Souldiers preſumed of reſt for that year, and divers Officers of the Army being of opinion, that it were better to aſſure and keep the places ſuſpected then to make any new attempt; yet all this notwithſtanding, he reſolved directly to encounter the danger, and gathering together the Enſignes of the Legions and ſome few Auxiliaries (becauſe the <hi>Ordovices</hi> durſt not deſcend into indifferent ground) himſelf firſt of all (to give others like courage) marched up to begin the aſſault. And having in that Conflict deſtroyed almoſt all the whole Nation of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> and knowing right well, that Fame muſt with inſtance be followed; (for as the reſt ſhould fall out, ſo the reſt would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) he deliberated to conquer the Iſle of <hi>Mona</hi> from the poſſeſſion whereof <hi>Paulinus</hi> had been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61256:66"/> formerly revoked by the general Rebellion of <hi>Brittany:</hi> But Ships being then wanting (as in an enterprize not intended before) the policy and reſoluteneſſe of the Captain, deviſed a ſpeedy paſſage: for he commanded the moſt chief of the Aids (to whom all the ſhallows were known, and who (after the uſe of their Country) were able to ſwim in their armour if need were, to lay aſide their carriage, and putting over at once ſuddenly to invade it, which thing ſo amazed the Inhabitants (who ſuppoſed that the <hi>Romans</hi> would have a certain time for Ships and ſuch like proviſion by ſea) that now believing nothing could be hard or invincible to men, which came ſo minded to make war, they humbly intreated for peace, and yielded the Iland. This <hi>Agricola</hi> at his firſt entrance into office (which time others uſed to conſume in vain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation and ambitious ſeeking of Ceremonies) entring withall into labours and dangers, became famous indeed and of great reputation. Howbeit he abuſed not the proſperous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his Affairs to vanity or braving in ſpeeches; for he eſteemed it an action not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of a Conqueſt, to keep in order onely perſons ſubdued by force, neither deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he with laurel his Letters of Advertiſement, but ſtopping and ſuppreſſing the ſame of his doings, he greatly augumented it, when men began to diſcourſe upon what great preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of future ſucceſſe he ſhould make ſo light an account of ſo great actions lately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                        <p>As touching the civil Government, <hi>Agricola</hi> knowing how the Province ſtood affected, and being taught of others that Armies avail little to ſettle a new conquered State (if violence and wrongs be permitted,) determined at the firſt to cut off all cauſes of War and Rebellion: and beginning at home, he firſt of all reformed his own houſe (a point of more hardneſſe to ſome men then to govern a Province.) He committed no manner of publick Affairs to Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Libertines, he received no Souldier near his perſon upon private affection of partial Suiters, nor upon commendation or intreaty of Centurions, but elected the beſt and moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. He would look narrowly into all things, yet not exact all things to the very moſt; light faults he would pardon and the great ſeverely correct, not alwayes puniſhing Offenders, but ofttimes ſatisfied with repentance, chooſing rather not to prefer to office ſuch as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to offend, then after the offence to condemn them.</p>
                        <p>The augmentation of Tribute and Corn, he tempered with equal dividing of burdens, cutting away thoſe petty extortions which grieved the <hi>Brittains</hi> more then the Tribute it ſelf; for the poor people in former times were conſtrained in a mockery to wait at the barn-doors which were locked againg them, firſt to lay Corn, and after to ſell at a low price: Several wayes alſo and far diſtant places had been aſſigned them by the purveyors appointmment, for carrying proviſions from the neareſt ſtanding Camps to thoſe which were far off and out of the way (petty Officers in the mean time making a gain thereof, by ſparing ſome, and charging others at their pleaſures) ſo as that which lay open to all at hand, was turned onely to the private profit of a few. By repreſſing theſe abuſes in his firſt year, a good opinion was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the peace, which either by negligence or partiality of former Lieutenants had been no leſſe feared then War.

Howbeit when by theſe means he had terrified the <hi>Brittains,</hi> then would he again ſpare and forbear, as hoping thereby to allure them to peace; whereupon many Cities (which before that time ſtood upon terms of equality <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Thus far had <hi>Agricola</hi> proceeded, when Newes came that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was dead, and <hi>Titus</hi> his Son inveſted in the Empire.</p>
                        <p>The Winter enſuing was ſpent in a moſt profitable and politick device; For whereas the <hi>Brittains</hi> were rude and diſperſed, and therefore prone upon every occaſion to War, <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> that he might induce by pleaſures to quietneſſe and reſt, exhorted them in private, and commanded his Souldiers to help them to build Temples, Houſes and places of publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, commending ſuch as were forward therein, and checking the ſlow and idle perſons, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereby to impoſe a kind of neceſſity upon them, while every man contended to gain the Lieutenants good will. Moreover the Noblemens Sons he took and cauſed to be inſtructed in the liberal Sciences, preferring the wits of the <hi>Brittains</hi> before thoſe of the Students in <hi>Gallia:</hi> The <hi>Brittains</hi> alſo themſelves being now curious to attain to the Eloquence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, whereas they lately rejected the Speech; after that the <hi>Roman</hi> Attire grew to be in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and the Gown much uſed among them, and ſo by little and little they proceeded to thoſe provocations of Vices, namely ſumptuous Galleries, hot Baths, and exquiſite ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettings, which things the ignorant people termed common civility, though it were indeed a badge of their bondage.</p>
                        <p>In the third year of his Government, he diſcovered new Countries, waſting all before him till he came to the <hi>Firth</hi> of<note n="a" place="margin">The River of <hi>Tweed.</hi>

                        <p>The fourth year of his Office was ſpent in viewing and ordering that which he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run; and if the valiant minds of his Souldiers and the glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name could have ſo permitted it, there ſhould have been no need to have ſought other limits of <hi>Brittany</hi> then were at that time diſcovered.

                        <p>Now in the ſummer following, becauſe a General riſing in Armes of the further Nations beyond <hi>Bodotria</hi> was feared (the paſſages being all beſet with the power of thoſe people) he manned a Fleet to ſearch the Creeks, and harbours of the ample Regions beyond it; backing them firſt of all with a Navy and a goodly ſhew, bringing War both by Sea and Land, and oftentimes it chanced that the Horſemen, Footmen, and the Sea Souldiers met and made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the ſame Camp, each man extolling his own proweſſe and adventures, and making vaunts and compariſons, Souldier like; ſome of the Woods and high Mountains that they had paſſed, others of dangers of Rocks &amp; Tempeſts that they had endured; the one of the Land, and the enemy defeated; the other of the Ocean, aſſaied and ſubdued; The <hi>Brittains</hi> (as by the priſoners it was underſtood) were much amazed at the fight of the Navy, ſuppoſing that (the ſecrets of their Sea being now diſcloſed) there remained no refuge for them, if they were overcome; whereupon the <hi>Caledonians</hi> arming with great preparation and great fame (as the manner is of matters unknown) began to aſſail their Enemies Caſtles, and ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captaines which would ſeem to be wiſe, being indeed but Cowards, counſelled the Generall to retire on this ſide <hi>Bodotria,</hi> and rather to depart of his own accord, then to be driven back with ſhame; In the mean time <hi>Agricola</hi> had knowledge, that the <hi>Brittains</hi> meant to divide themſelves and give the onſet in ſeveral Companies, whereupon leaſt he ſhould be incloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and entrapped either by their multitude, or by their skill in the paſſages; he marched alſo with his Army divided in three patts; which when it was known unto the <hi>Calidonians,</hi> they changed advice on the ſudden, and uniting their Forces together, jointly aſſaulted by night the ninth Legion, as being of weakeſt reſiſtance; and having ſlain the watch (partly aſleep and partly amazed with fear) they broke into the Camp, and were fighting within the trenches; when <hi>Agricola</hi> having underſtood by ſpies what the <hi>Brittains</hi> had taken, and following their footſteps, commanded the lighteſt Horſemen and Footmen to play upon their backs, and to maintain the skirmiſh: when the day drew near, the glittering of the Enſigns dazled the eyes of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who being daunted with fear of danger on each ſide, began to draw back, &amp; the <hi>Romans</hi> like men that were now out of peril of their lives, did fight more chearfully for their honour, freſhly aſſailing the <hi>Brittains</hi> and driving them to their own Gates, where in the very ſtreets the conflict was ſharp and cruell; till in the end the <hi>Brittains</hi> were forced to flie, whilſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces ſeverally purſued them, contending with a kind of emulation, the one to have helped the other, and the other to ſeem to have needed no help; upon the ſucceſs of this battle, the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers preſuming, that to their power all things were eaſie, and openly cried to the <hi>General</hi> to lead them into <hi>Caledonia,</hi> that with a courſe of continual conqueſt they might find out the utmoſt limits of <hi>Brittain;</hi> Now ſuch as before the battle were ſo weary and wiſe in adventuring, waxed forward enough after the event; and grew to ſpeak gloriouſly of themſelves (ſuch is the hard condition of war, if ought fall out wel all challenge a part, misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes commonly are imputed to one) contrariwiſe the <hi>Brittains</hi> (preſuppoſing that no true valour but the coming of the General by uſing the occaſion had carried away the victory) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated not much their wonted courage, but armed their youths, tranſported their children and Wives into places of ſafety, and ſought by Aſſemblies and Religious rights to eſtabliſh an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of the Cities together, and ſo for that year both parties as Enemies departed incenſed away.</p>

                        <p>WHen I conſider the cauſe of this War, and our preſent neceſſity, I have reaſon (me ſeems) to preſume that this day, and this our general agreement will give a happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the freedom of the whole Iſland; for we have all hitherto lived in liberty, and now no Land remaineth beyond us, no Sea for our ſafety. The <hi>Roman</hi> Navy as you ſee ſurveying and environing our Coaſts, ſo that combat and Armes, which men of vertue deſire for honour, the daſtard muſt alſo uſe for his ſecurity; The former battles which have with divers events been fought with the <hi>Romans,</hi> had their refuge and hope reſting in our hands; for we the flower of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nobility, and ſeated in the furtheſt part of the Iſle, did never yet ſee the borders of thoſe Countries which were brought under ſervile ſubjection, (our eyes being ſtill kept unpolluted and free from all contagion of Tyranny) beyond us is no land, beſides us none are free, us only hither to this corner and ſecret harbour hath defended; you ſee the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt part of the line is laid open, and things the leſſe they be, which in knowledge the greater is the glory to atchieve them; but what Nation is there now beyond us? what elſe but water and Rocks, and the <hi>Romans</hi> Lords of all within the Land, whoſe intolerable pride in vain ſhall you ſeek to avoid by ſervices and humble behaviour. They are the Robbers of the world, that having now left no Land to be ſpoiled, ſearch alſo the Sea: if the enemy be Rich, they ſeek to win wealth; if poor, they are content to gain the glory to themſelves; whom neither the Eaſt or Weſt can ſatisfie, as being the only men of all Memory, that ſeek out all places, be they wealthy or poor, with like greedy affection; to take away by main force, to kill and ſpoile, they term Empire and Government, when all is waſt as wilderneſſe, that they call peace; his Children and blood each man holds moſt dear, and yet even they are preſſed for Souldiers and carried away to be ſlaves we know not where; our Siſters and Wives, though they be not violently forced as in open Hoſtility, yet are they under the colour and title of friends and gueſts ſhamefully abuſed, our goods and ſubſtance they daily draw from us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding us only with ſtripes and indignities, ſlaves which are born to bondage, and ſold but once, and after are fed at their owners expences; but <hi>Brittain</hi> daily burieth, and daily feedeth, and is at charge with her own bondage, and as in a private retinue the freſh man and laſt comer is ſcoffed at by his fellow ſervants; ſo in this old ſervitude of the whole world, they ſeek only the deſtruction of us, as being the lateſt attempted, and of all others in their opinion the moſt vile, we have no Fields to Mannure, no Mines to be digged, no Ports to trade in, and to what purpoſe then ſhould they keep us alive: conſidering that the manhood and fierce courage of the Subject doth not much pleaſe the jealous Soveraigne. And this corner (being ſo ſecret and out of the way) the more ſecurity it yieldeth to us, the greater ſuſpition it worketh in them; ſeeing therefore all hope of pardon is paſt, it behoveth you at length to ſhew courage in defending and maintaining both your ſafety and honour. The <hi>Ige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> led by a Woman Fired the <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, Forced the Caſtles, and had the proſecution of the War, being anſwerable to ſo lucky a beginning; the Southern <hi>Brittains</hi> might have then with eaſe ſhaken off the yoak, and prevented our perill; we as yet never touched, never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but born to be free, not ſlaves to the <hi>Romans;</hi> we I ſay are now to make proof of our Valour, and to ſhew in this encounter what manner of men <hi>Calidonia</hi> hath reſerved in ſtore for her ſelf. Do you think that the <hi>Romans</hi> be Valiant in War as they are wanton in peace; no, you are deceived; for they are grown famous not by their own vertue, but by our jars and diſcord, while they make uſe of their enemies faults, to the glory of their own Army, compoſed of moſt divers Nations; and therefore as by preſent proſperity it is holden toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo doubtleſſe (if fortune frown on that ſide) it will ſoon be diſſolved, unleſſe you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Gauls</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> and (to our ſhame be it ſpoken) many of our own Nation (which now lend their lives to eſtabliſh a Foreign Uſurper) to be led with any true-hearted and faithful affection. No it is rather with terrour and diſtruſt (weak-workers of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61256:68"/> love) which if you remove, then thoſe which have made an end to fear, will ſoon begin to hate. All things that may encourage and give hope of Victory, are now for us. The <hi>Romans</hi> have no Wives to hearten them on if they faint, nor Parents to upbraid them if they fly: moſt of them have no Country at all, or if they have, it is ſome other mens. They ſtand like a ſort of fearful perſons trembling and gazing at the ſtrangeneſſe of Heaven it ſelf, at the ſea and the Woods. And now the Heavens (favouring our cauſe) have delivered them (mewed up, as it were and fettered) into our hands; be not terrified or diſmaid with the vain-ſhew and glittering of their gold and ſilver, which of themſelves do neither offend nor defend. And think that even amongſt our enemies we ſhall find ſome of our ſide, when the <hi>Brittains</hi> ſhall acknowledge their own cauſe, the <hi>Gauls</hi> remember their old Freedom, and the reſt of the <hi>Germans</hi> forſake them, as of late the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſipians</hi> did; what then ſhould we fear? The Caſtles are empty, the Colonies peopled with aged and impotent perſons, the free Cities diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and diſtracted with factions, whilſt they which are under, obey with ill will, and they do govern and rule without right. Here is the <hi>Roman</hi> General and the Army, their Tributes &amp; Mines, with other miſeries, inſeparably following ſuch as live under ſubjection of others, which whether we are to endure for ever, or ſpeedily to revenge, it lieth this day in this Field to determine; wherefore being now to joyn Battel, bear in mind I beſeech you, both your Anceſtors (which lived in the happy eſtate of Liberty) and your Succeſſors, who (if you fail in this enterprize) ſhall live hereafter in perpetual ſervitude. This Speech delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (with great vehemency of voice and action) was chearfully received by the <hi>Brittains,</hi> with a Song (after their faſhion) accompanied with confuſed cries and acclamations.</p>
                        <p>As the <hi>Roman</hi> Cohorts drew together and diſcovered themſelves, whilſt ſome of the boldeſt preſſed forward, the reſt put themſelves in array; and <hi>Agricola</hi> albeit his Souldiers were glad of that day, and could ſcarce with words have been withholden, yet ſuppoſing it fit to ſay ſomewhat, He encouraged them in this wiſe.</p>

                           <hi>AGRICOLA</hi> his Speech to his Souldiers.</head>
                        <p>FEllow-ſouldiers and Companions in Arms, your faithful diligence and ſervice theſe eight years ſo painfully performed, by the Vertue and Fortune of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, hath at length conquered <hi>Brittany.</hi> In ſo many Journeys, ſo many Battels we were of neceſſity to ſhew our ſelves either valiant againſt the Enemy, or patient and laborious above and againſt nature it ſelf; in all which Exploits, we have both of us carried our ſelves, as neither I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired better Souldiers, nor you other Captains. We have exceeded the limits, I of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and you likewiſe of yours. The end of <hi>Brittany</hi> is now found, not by Fame and Report, but we are with our Arms and Pavillions really inveſted thereof. <hi>Brittany</hi> is found and ſubdued.</p>
                        <p>In your marching heretofore, when the paſſage of Bogs, Mountains and Rivers troubled and tired you, how often have I heard the valiant Souldiers ſay, When will the Enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf? Lo now they are put out of their holes, and here they are come; lo now your wiſh; lo here the place for trial of your Vertue, and all things likely to follow in a good and eaſie courſe if you win; contrariwiſe all againſt you if you loſe. For as to have gone ſo much ground, eſcaped the Woods and Bogs, and paſſed over ſo many arms of the ſea, are honourable teſtimonies of your forwardneſſe; ſo if we fly, the advantage we have had, will become our greateſt diſadvantage. For we are not ſo skilful in the Countrey, we have not the like ſtore of proviſion; we have only hands and weapons, wherein our Hopes, our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and all things elſe are included. For mine own part, I have been long ſince reſolved that to ſhew our backs is diſhonourable, both for Souldier and General; and therefore a commendable death is better then life with reproach, (ſurety and honour commonly dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together.) Howbeit, if ought ſhould miſhappen in this Enterprize, yet this will be a glory for us to have died even in the utmoſt end of the world and of nature: if new Nations and Souldiers unknown were in the field, I would by the example of other Armies encourage you. But now I require you only to recount your own victorious Exploits, and to ask counſel of your own eyes; theſe are the ſame men which the laſt year aſſailed one Legion by ſtealth in the night, and were ſuddenly and in a manner by the blaſts of your mouths overthrown. Theſe of all the <hi>Brittains</hi> have been moſt nimble in running away, and by that means have eſcaped the longeſt alive. For as in Forreſts and Woods the ſtrongeſt Beaſts are chaſed away by main force, and the cowardly and fearful ſcarce only by the noiſe of the Hunters; ſo the moſt valiant of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Nation, we have already diſpatched; the raskal herd of daſtardly cowards only remaineth; and lo, we have now at length found them, not as intending to ſtay and making Head againſt us, but as laſt overtaken, and by extreme paſſion of fear, ſtanding like ſtocks, and preſenting to us occaſion in this place of a worthy and memorable Victory. Now therefore make a ſhort work of a long warfare, and to almoſt fifty years travel let this day impoſe a glorious end. Let each of you ſhew his Valour, and approve to your Country, that this Army of ours could never juſtly be charged, either with protracting the War for fear or upon falſe pretences, for not accompliſhing the Conqueſt.</p>

                        <p>As <hi>Agricola</hi> was ſpeaking the Souldiers gave great tokens of their fervent deſire to fight, and when he had ended his Speech, they joyfully applauded it, running ſtreight wayes to their weapons and ruſhing furiouſly forward, which the <hi>Roman</hi> General perceiving forthwith orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Army in this manner: with the Auxiliary Footmen he fortified the middle Battle, The Horſemen he placed in the wings on both ſides, The Legions he commanded to ſtand behind, Before the Trench of the Camp, to the greater glory of the Victory, if it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, without <hi>Roman</hi> blood, or otherwiſe for aſſiſtance, if the forward ſhould be diſtreſſed, The <hi>Brittains</hi> were marſhalled on the higher ground fitly to ſhew and to terrifie their enemies: The firſt Troop ſtanding on the plain, the reſt on the aſcent of the hill, riſing up as it were by degrees one over another. The middle of the Field was filled with Chariots and Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, clattering and running round about. Then <hi>Agricola</hi> finding them to exceed him in number, and fearing leaſt he ſhould be aſſailed, on the Front and Flanks both at one inſtant, thought it beſt to diſplay his Army in length, and although by that means the Battel would become diſproportionably long, and many adviſed him to take the Legions: yet he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rejected the counſel, and leaving his Horſe, advanced himſelf before the Enſignes on Foot. In the firſt Encounter before they joyned both ſides, diſcharged and threw their darts. The <hi>Brittains</hi> imploying both Art and Valour, with great Swords and little Targets defended themſelves and wounded their Enemies, till <hi>Agricola</hi> eſpying his advantage, appointed three<note n="a" place="margin">Companies of <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Battanian</hi> Cohorts, and two of the<note n="b" place="margin">The ancient Inhabitants of the Territory of Leige in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> 
                           <hi>Tungrians</hi> to preſſe forward, and to bring the matter to Handy-ſtroaks and dint of ſword, which they by reaſon of their long ſervice were able readily to perform to the prejudice of the other ſide, in regard of their little Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and huge Swords. For the Swords of the <hi>Brittains</hi> being weighty and blunt-pointed, were neither fit either for the cloſe or open fight. Now as the <hi>Battanians</hi> began to ſtrike them on the faces with the pikes of their Bucklers, and (having overborn ſuch as reſiſted) to march up to the Mountains, the reſt of the Cohorts (gathering Courage upon emulation) violently beat down all about them, and running forward left ſome of the <hi>Brittains</hi> half dead, ſome wholly untouched for haſte, as deſirous to have part of the glory in winning the Field. In the mean time, both the Chariots of the <hi>Brittains</hi> mingled themſelves with their enemies Battel of Footmen, and alſo their Troops of Horſemen; (albeit they had lately ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified others) yet now themſelves beginning to fly were diſtreſſed by the unevenneſs of the ground and the thick ranks of their enemies, who continued the Fight till the <hi>Brittains</hi> by main weight of their own Horſes and Chariots were born down one upon another; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterleſs Horſes afrighted, running up and down with the Chariots, and many times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing their Friends which either met them or thwarted their way.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Brittains</hi> who ſtood aloof from the Battel, upon the top of the Hills, and did at the firſt in a manner, diſdain the ſmall number of their enemies, began to come downe by little and little, and ſought to fetch a compaſſe about the backes of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which were then in train of winning the Field. But <hi>Agricola</hi> ſuſpecting, as much oppoſed them with certain wings of horſemen, purpoſely retained about him for ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſpatches upon all chances, and repulſed them as fiercely as they ran to aſſaile; So the council of the <hi>Brittains</hi> turning to their own hurt, the <hi>Roman</hi> wings were commanded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the battle and follow the Flight; then were there pitifull ſpectacles to be ſeen, purſuing, wounding, taking priſoners and then killing ſuch as were taking as ſoon as others came in the way. Then the whole Regiments of the <hi>Brittains</hi> (though armed and more in number) turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their backs to the fewer, others unarmed fought their own death, offering themſelves vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to the ſlaughter; The fields every where were imbrued with blood; every where weapons lay ſcattered, wounded bodies, mangled limbs, ſome ſlain out right, ſome half dead, ſome yielding up the Ghoſt, and yet even at the laſt gaſpe ſeeming by their countenances to diſcover both anger and valour; ſuch of the <hi>Brittains</hi> as in flying recovered the Woods, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves together again and intrapped unawares ſome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers that unadviſedly followed, not knowing the Countrey; and if <hi>Agricola</hi> had not, by his preſence and direction aſſiſted at need, ſetting about them his moſt expert Footmen (as it were in form of a Tayle) and commanded ſome of his Horſemen to leave them Horſes (where the paſſage was narrow) and others to enter ſingle on horſeback where the wood was thin, doubtleſs the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken a blow by their own over much boldneſſe; but after that the <hi>Brittains</hi> ſaw them again in good array, and orderly following the chaſe, they fled (not in Troops as before, when they attended each other, but utterly disbanded, ſhunning ill company) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the deſart and farre diſtant places; the darkneſſe of the night and ſatiety of the blood, made an end of the chaſe; of the <hi>Brittains</hi> were then ſtain about ten thouſand, of the <hi>Romans</hi> 300 and 40. amongſt whom the chief man of note was <hi>Aulus Atticus,</hi> the Captain of a Cohort, who upon a youthful heat, and through the fierceneſs of his Horſe, was carried into the middeſt of his Enemies; that night the winners refreſhed themſelves, taking pleaſure in talking of the victory, and dividing the ſpoile; but the <hi>Brittains</hi> uttterly diſcouraged, crying and howling (both men and women together) took and drew with them their wounded perſons, calling the not wounded, forſaking their own Houſes, and in deſpair ſetting them on fire; then ſeeking holes abroad to lurk in, and having found them, ſtraight awayes again forſaking them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times communicating Councels together, conceiving ſome little hope, and then by and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and deſperate, ſometimes moved with pity at the ſight of their Kinsfolks and Friends,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61256:69"/> and ſometimes ſtirred with rage and envy in thinking and ſpeaking of their Enemies (which was moſt lamentable) ſome of them by way of compaſſion and mercy killing their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Wives.</p>
                        <p>The day following did more plainly diſcover the greatneſs of the victory, by the calamity of the vanquiſhed deſolation and ſilence every where, the ſmoak of the houſes fired appeared a far off: no ſallies out of the woods, no ſtirring in the Mountains, no man to make reſiſtance, or to meet with the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpies, who being ſent abroad into all quarters, found by the print of the <hi>Brittains</hi> footſteps that their flight was uncertain, and that they were no where in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies together, but ſcattered in divers places, and altogether unable to make any new attempt upon the ſudden; wherefore <hi>Agricola</hi> the ſummer being now ſpent in this journey, and the time paſt for any other imployment, brought his Army into the borders of the<note n="a" place="margin">The Ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Eskdale</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (as it is conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.)</note> 
                           <hi>Horeſtians</hi> Countrey, where having received Hoſtages of the Inhabitants, he commanded the Admiral of his Navy (being furniſhed with Souldiers and ſufficient ſtrength for that purpoſe) to ſaile about <hi>Brittain,</hi> whether the Fame and Terror of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name was already gone before. Then he planted Gariſons upon the borders between <hi>Blota</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> and diſpoſed of his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Horſemen in the wintering places within the Province. Thus after many Conflicts about the ſpace of one hundred thirty ſix years from <hi>Julius Cæſar</hi>'s firſt entrance, the utmoſt limits of <hi>Brittany</hi> and the Iſles of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> lying on the North ſide of it, were by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Induſtry of <hi>Julius Agricola</hi> firſt diſcovered and made known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the South part of the Iſle in the fourth year of the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> being in the year of our Redemption 86, reduced into a full Province, the Government whereof was particular to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours themſelves, and not at the diſpoſition of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>This ſtate of affairs here <hi>Agricola</hi> ſignified by letters (without any amplifying terms to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> the Succeſſour of <hi>Titus</hi> his brother in the Empire) who after his manner with a chearful countenance and grieved heart, received the news, being inwardly pricked with anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, to think that his late counterfeit triumph of <hi>Germany</hi> (wherein a ſhew was made of ſlaves bought for mony, attired like Captives of that Country) was had in deriſion and juſtly ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereas now a true &amp; great victory (ſo many thouſand of Enemies being ſlain) was currant in every mans mouth: beſides he eſteemed it a moſt perilous point in a ſtate, that a private mans name ſhould be exalted above the name of a Prince; and he ſuppoſed that he had in vain ſuppreſſed the ſtudy of Oratory, and all other publick Arts, if he ſhould in military Glory be excelled by another; for matters of other kinds, as he ſuppoſed might more eaſily be paſſed over, but to be a good Commander of an Army, was to be above a private eſtate, that being a private eſtate peculiar to a Prince; <hi>Domitian</hi> being tormented with theſe and the like conceits, and muſing much in his cloſet above (which was commonly noted as a ſign of ſome miſchief in working) thought it beſt for the preſent to cloak and diſſemble his malice, till the heat of <hi>Agricola</hi>'s glory, and the love of his Souldiers were ſomewhat abated (for as yet <hi>Agricola</hi> remained in office: wherefore he commanded that all the houours of Triumphal Ornaments, the image Triumphal, and what elſe was uſually beſtowed in lieu of triumph, ſhould in moſt ample and honourable terms be awarded him in the Senate: and then ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Succeſſour, he cauſed a brute to ſpread, that the Province of <hi>Syria</hi> (which was then void, and ſpecially reſerved for men of great quality) ſhould be aſſigned to <hi>Agricola;</hi> the common opinion was that <hi>Domitian</hi> ſending one of his moſt ſecret &amp; truſty ſervants unto him ſent with all the Commiſſion for the Lieutenancie of <hi>Syria,</hi> with private inſtructions, that if <hi>Agoicola</hi> at the time of his coming, ſhould be ſtill in <hi>Brittain,</hi> then it ſhould be delivered; if otherwiſe it ſhould be kept back; and that the ſame man meeting <hi>Agricola</hi> as he croſſed the Seas, without ſpeaking to him or delivering the meſſage, returned again unto <hi>Domitian;</hi> whether this were true or fained upon a probable ſurmiſe, as agreeable to the Princes diſpoſition, it could not be directly affirmed; But in the mean ſeaſon, <hi>Agricola</hi> had yielded up the Province in good and peaceable eſtate unto (<hi>Neus Trebellius,</hi> or rather as ſome Authors report) to <hi>Saluſtius Lucullus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Agricola</hi> leaſt his coming to <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have bin noted by reaſon of the multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which would have gone out to ſee and meet him, did warily cut off the occaſion of that curteſie, entring the City by night (and by night as he was commanded) came to the Palace, where being admitted to the Princes preſence, and received with a ſhort ſalutation, and no further ſpeech, he ſorted himſelf with other Gentlemen of his rank, carrying himſelf ever after very temperately &amp; warily in all his actions, as knowing the preſent ſtate of thoſe times, &amp; the dangerous inclination of the Emperor himſelf, who being (as all other Princes are commonly) more fearful and jealous of the good then the bad, envyed in him thoſe vertues &amp; that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reputation, whereof himſelf was not capable; yet, as good deſerts cannot be hide (true worthineſſe ſhining even in darkneſſe it ſelf) ſo the retired life which <hi>Agricola</hi> led, did nothing diminiſh his glory, but rather like water ſprinkled on a burning fire, encreaſed and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the heat thereof. Divers times was he accuſed in his abſence (which miniſtred to his ill-willers opportunity of working his diſgrace) and as often in abſence was he acquitted the opinion only of his good deſerts, and no matter of crime giving occaſion, while ſuch as highly commended him to the Emperor (ſeeming his friends but indeed being the moſt peſtilent kind of Enemies,) procured underhand his peril and ruine in the end. Howbeit the ill ſucceſſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies in divers Provinces at that time, ſerving as a foil to ſet out his Honourable Actions, drew him perforce into glory; and <hi>Domitian</hi> made pretences of his purpoſe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61256:69"/> him thinking thereby to ſatisfie the people who then complained of the want of good Leaders. But vertue that never continueth long time in proſperous Eſtate (as being the common object of envy) haſtned the death of <hi>Agricola,</hi> who (as the conſtant fame went) was made away by poiſon; and that not without the Emperors knowledge and conſent. Theſe things concerning <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Government in <hi>Brittain,</hi> I have ſet down particularly as they are reported by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who writ the Story of his life, which remaineth to the World as a perpetual Monument of the Doings of the one, and the Writings of the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saluſtius Lucullus</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Agricola,</hi> left little Memory of himſelf, by doing any thing here, either for that no occaſion was then offered to ſhew himſelf in action, or elſe for that the Fame of ſo worthy a Predeceſſor blemiſhed his Reputation; for having held the Office but a ſhort time, he was by commandment of <hi>Domitian</hi> put to death for ſuffering certain Spears of a new faſhion to be called by his own name.</p>
                        <p>About this time, <hi>Arviragus</hi> a <hi>Brittain</hi> by birth and education, did Govern as King part of the Iſle of <hi>Brittain:</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> accounting it a point of policy to permit the <hi>Brittains</hi> ſometimes to be ruled by Princes of their own Nation, whoſe Aid and Counſel they might uſe (upon occaſions) to the pacifying of Rebellion, and the eſtabliſhing of their own greatneſſe. For the common people (whoſe affection doth oftentimes ſway the Fortunes of Princes) are much more eaſily brought under the Obedience of their own Countrymen then of Strangers.</p>

                        <p>It is reported that he was Foundet of a Church at <hi>Cornhill</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which he dedicated to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> placeing therein one <hi>Thean</hi> an Archbiſhop to have the ſuperintendence over other Biſhops within his principality; and the Metropolitan ſeat continued there in the ſucceſſion of thirteen Archbiſhops (about the ſpace of 400 years) until the coming of St. <hi>Aug.</hi> who tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it to <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

                        <p>This St. <hi>Timothy</hi> was aſſiſted by St. <hi>Marcellus</hi> a <hi>Britain</hi> alſo, and preached here; and the Annals of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Trevers</hi> ſay of this Man, That <hi>Lucius</hi> King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> now <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was baptized by his preaching. The Hiſtorie of <hi>Tungers</hi> ſpeaketh more plainly, That this St <hi>Marcellus</hi> did by his preaching convert <hi>Lucius</hi> Prince of <hi>Brittain</hi> with all his Nation to Chriſt. And the ſame Catalogue of <hi>Trevers</hi> ſaith, That King <hi>Lucius</hi> was made a Chriſtian, and Baptized by this our Renowned Countryman St. <hi>Marcellus.</hi>

                        <p>When the eſtate of Eccleſiaſticall affairs had taken in <hi>Brittain</hi> ſo happy proceeding and effect, that both our King and many principall men were thus converted to the Faith of Chriſt, from their former errors and ſuperſtitions, and ſo great hope and forwardneſſe there was, to have that faith publickly profeſſed, which they privately embraced, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the only Truth; many worldly temptations and oppoſitions did preſently ariſe to hinder theſe new and untrained Souldiers of Chriſt, to make ſo bold and open profeſſion of their holy Religion, as many holy Martyrs at that time, and they themſelves not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did, and the glory of that required;<note place="margin">Divers hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fears and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now chancing and hindring of K. <hi>Lucius</hi> from open profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion in <hi>Brittain.</hi>
                           </note> for as we may probably with many Antiquities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the favourable edicts of divers Emperours, and among them <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Pius</hi> yet Reigning, had ſomewhat encouraged them in temporal reſpects, actually to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in that Religion, which their internal underſtanding and judgement was by many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible motives and arguments convinced before to be only true; ſo now by like contrary worldly events and letts, they were for ſome time more ſlow and dull to profeſſe it openly. They did perfectly underſtand, that not withſtanding the pretended and expected favour from the preſent Emperour, either by his command or permiſſion, two holy Popes (to omit many other places) St. <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> and St. <hi>Higinus,</hi> procurers of their converſion, cruelly were put to Death for that Religion, even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, under the Emperours ſight, within the ſpace of four years or little more, by all accounts: and becauſe preſent and home dangers do moſt terrifie, they did ſee and taſte that the preſent Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> was at this time incenſed againſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and had already ſent <hi>Lollius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbicus</hi> with forces hither, and he had Fought ſome battles againſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> as both our own and the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians teſtifie.</p>
                        <p>And to maintain and foſter theſe conceived and ingendred humane fears and impreſſions, to live and continue longer then <hi>Antoninus</hi> was like to live, now being old and long time Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, when he came firſt to the Empire by the Adoption of <hi>Adrian,</hi> he was commanded or directed by him that <hi>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,</hi>

And yet he muſt needs be a renowned Man long before that time, and ſo no marvel if divers Letters were written to him from <hi>Brittain,</hi> and from him hither before his Papacy; eſpecially if we reflect and conſider how probable a thing it is that he was moſt reſident with our Chriſtian <hi>Brittains</hi> there, and the Popes of that time committed unto him to have a peculiar care of this Country, with his great credit and familiarity with Pope <hi>Pius</hi> converſing ſo much with our <hi>Brittains</hi> there,<note place="margin">Euſeb.

And that this his glory was ſo great in <hi>Brittain</hi> before he was Pope, thoſe our both ancient and later Hiſtorians prove, which ſay, that King <hi>Lucius</hi> wrote unto him the firſt year of his Conſecration, to take order for the general converſion of this Kingdome.<note place="margin">

For the very beginning of any ruler or Governour cannot give him ſo ſingular a commendation ſo ſoon, eſpecially where his Regiment is ſo great and ample, that in ſo ſhort a time he can hardly take notice of the ſtate of thoſe things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto his charge, much leſſe take ſo good order for them all, that his Fame and Honour ſhould be for that doing reported in all the World. And King <hi>Lucius</hi> ſending unto him in the firſt year of his papacy, and the very beginning thereof, could not poſſibly have notice of his ſo renowned carriage therein, conſult with all his Nobles, Flamens and Arch-flamens ſo diſperſed in this ſo large a Kingdome, and have their general conſent, for a general conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſend notice of this by ſolemn Embaſſadours ſo long a journey to be there in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his papacy: but that this great honour and fame of St. <hi>Elutherius</hi> was here renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long before, and this publick and general aſſent to forſake idolatry and embrace Chriſtian Religion had been formerly concluded and agreed upon in <hi>Brittain;</hi> and very probably as our <hi>Cambridge</hi> Antiquities have told us, not only St. <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſent or returned to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this buſineſſe but <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduvinus</hi> alſo, as they write, being but Catechumens to be inſtructed and conſecrated there towards the performing ſo great a work in this Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Neither can we with equality of judgement think, that among ſo many <hi>Brittains</hi> now converted or ſo diſpoſed here, theſe two onely went from hence thither to ſuch end and purpoſe: But although theſe be the onely men remembred in Hiſtories to have been there employed, as more worthy, or elſe deſigned and ſent by King <hi>Lucius;</hi> yet there went many others about this time from <hi>Brittain</hi> thither, the better to enable themſelves for a general Converſion of this their Country, and there continued to enable themſelves with Learning and Religion, to be made fit Inſtruments and Workmen in thoſe holy Labours, and were therein aſſiſted both by the popes of thoſe times (much converſant with our Country <hi>Brittains,</hi> and in their Houſes at <hi>Rome</hi>) and others the moſt Renowned in the Clergy at that time, among whom St. <hi>Elutherius</hi> after Pope and happy Converter of this Nation was a chief Man.

                           <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> in his Manuſcript-Hiſtory of <hi>Glaſten.</hi> and other old Antiquities do prove, that St. <hi>Damianus</hi> and <hi>Faganus</hi> after they had converted this Kingdome, continued nine years at <hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> at the leaſt; King <hi>Lucius</hi> ſtill living and reigning here. <hi>Polidor, Lilly, Hollinſhed, Stow</hi> and others, cleave to this Opinion.</p>
                        <p>A great Controverſie ariſeth where this King died; many Forreign Authors ſay, That he forſook his Crown and Kingdome, and became a Clergyman, went into <hi>Germany</hi> to convert that Nation, was Biſhop of <hi>Curre</hi> and there was Martyred: the day of his death is agreed upon by all, to have been on the third day of <hi>December;</hi> but if thoſe Authors who tranſport this our bleſſed King into <hi>Germany,</hi> look but upon what hath been ſaid before, they ſhall find that it was not <hi>Lucius</hi> who was actually King of Brittain, and converted by the means of St. <hi>Elutherius,</hi> but another <hi>Lucius</hi> who was indeed Son of a King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and might have been King himſelf, had he not been baniſhed for the reaſon before related: and this was that St. <hi>Lucius</hi> who with his ſiſter St. <hi>Emerita</hi> were both Crowned with the glorious Crown of Martyrdome in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That our firſt Chriſtian K. <hi>Lucius</hi> could not be Biſhop of <hi>Curre</hi> is evident; for having been ſo long King here, he was ſo diſabled for Age, that he was nor capable of ſuch a journey. Further, they which hold he was Biſhop of <hi>Curre</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and Martyred there, ſay his Martyrdome was about the year of Chriſt 182. whereas this our King was living nine years after; beſides, they ſay that St. <hi>Emerita</hi> was his ſiſter.</p>
                        <p>But it is evident by our Hiſtories, that our firſt Chriſtian King <hi>Lucius</hi> had neither brother, ſiſter, nor child begotten by King <hi>Coillus</hi> in his old Age, having no other Child; whereby it is evident, that this King <hi>Lucius</hi> had neither brother nor ſiſter; and with what probability can it be affirmed, that a King ſo holy and loving of his Countries good and quiet, having no Chriſtian Heir to ſuceeed him, would or in conſcience could forſake his Native Country and Subjects in ſuch a caſe, that were in juſtice belonging to his chiefeſt charge, which no other could execute, to preach unto Forreigners, which many of his Subjects and others could, and at his requeſt moſt willingly would have performed.</p>
                        <p>We read in Hiſtories that many deſcended of Regal race, have in ſuch caſes been taken forth of their Monaſteries and Religious Converſation to govern Kingdoms deſtitute of Heirs; but that a King ſo vertuous, wiſe, loving, and beloved of his Country, having no ſuch Heir to ſucceed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61256:76"/> him, but by ſuch courſe to expoſe and leave his Kingdom to ſo many certain miſeries and calamities, as fell upon <hi>Brittain</hi> by the death of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and probably were foreſeen of all wiſemen, did, might, would, or could take ſuch a courſe, Antiquities have no example, Juſtice denyeth it, Charity cannot allow it.<note place="margin">Seb.

                           <hi>Sebaſtian Manſter</hi> ſaith plainly, that whereas there is a Vulgar report (he maketh no more of any <hi>Lucius</hi> preaching there) that one <hi>Lucius</hi> preached there, if it were ſo, it could not poſſibly be our firſt Chriſtian King <hi>Lucius;</hi> for he never went out of <hi>Brittain,</hi> but very Godly lived and dyed here. <hi>Gaſpar Bruchius</hi> doth alſo plainly reject all that Hiſtory, as it is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome to our <hi>Lucius,</hi> and among other reaſons addeth, that the great difference of years, will not permit it to be true. An old French Manuſcript joyneth in the ſame, leaveth him living, dying, buried in <hi>Brittain.</hi> And if we come home to our own Hiſtorians and Antiquities, moſt likely to make the moſt true and certain relation of this their ſo renowned King, they ſet down the year, the day,<note place="margin">Antiq.

Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſetting down the time, as before, ſaith, he dyed at <hi>Glocester,</hi> and was honourably buried there in the Cathedral. The old Manuſcript of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Cornhil,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> avoucheth from divers Antiquities, that he was buried at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where the Church of St. <hi>Francis</hi> was after builded, being at the time of his death, the Cathedral and Epiſcopal Church of the City. <hi>John Harding</hi> alſo witneſſeth of this Kings death and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial at <hi>Glocester.</hi>

                        <p>And not to exclude the teſtimony of our later writers in this relation, in their Theater of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> written and compoſed by divers able Hiſtorians,<note place="margin">Theater of great <hi>Brittain</hi> l. 6. c. 9. ſect. 18.</note> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with common applauſe, they make this Hiſtory of King <hi>Lucius</hi> his death in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> a matter without queſtion true, and thus ſcoffingly condemn thoſe writers, which would carry him to end his dayes in <hi>Germany: That this</hi> Lucius <hi>be the Apoſtle of the</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians, <hi>or that his ſiſter</hi> Emerita <hi>was crowned with the flames of Martyrdom,</hi>

                           <hi>fifteen years after his death, I leave to the credit of</hi> Aegidius Schudus, <hi>and</hi> Hermanus Schedelius <hi>the Reporters: Others of them plainly ſay:</hi> Lucius <hi>was buried at</hi> Gloceſter: yet this general conſent of Antiquaries, for his firſt burial at <hi>Glocester</hi> doth nothing hinder, but as the known devotion, both of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> as Saxons after them, towards holy Relicks did often and with great devotion and ſolemnity remove the bodies of holy Saints, or parts of them for their greater honour. So it might, or did after fall out with the whole body of this renowned King, or ſome part thereof. And the Tradition of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is, that the whole body of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> or a great part thereof being, once removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (probably to <hi>Caerleon,</hi> for ſome ſay he was buried there) was the ſecond time tranſlated thither, and there lyeth in the body of the great Church under a marble ſtone, elevated about two foot from the pavement, the ſame ſtone being now broaken in two places, having upon it, and thoſe holy Relicks, a croſs of ſeven great braſs buttons, whereof 5. are ſet down in length the other two making the perfect figure, and forme of the croſs, one on each ſide of the others making the length. And this Reverend Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of St. <hi>Lucius</hi> his body to divers places in <hi>Brittain,</hi> is ſufficiently inſinuated by the old Author of the French Manuſcript Hiſtory, who although he confidently affirmeth that King <hi>Lucius</hi> dyed at <hi>Glocester,</hi> yet he addeth that he was afterwards buried in the chief See at <hi>Caerleon,</hi> and this he ſaith was in the year of Chriſts incarnation, 196. four or five years ſooner then others before have ſet down his death, except the Manuſcript Compilation, which hath the ſame computation of his death, ſaying, <hi>Sepultus est anno In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnationis Domini</hi> 196. <hi>herede carens,</hi> he was buried in the 196. year after the incarnation of our Lord, wanting Iſſue or heir.</p>
                        <p>And both to aſſure us further of the undoubted truth of thoſe Hiſtories, which teſtifie the death and burial of St. <hi>Lucius</hi> to have been in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and not in any forraign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as alſo to give us better notion and trial, what honour, peace, and quiet, ſpiritual and temporal, with other happineſs, this Kingdom enjoyed by King <hi>Lucius</hi> life, and loſt them by the loſs of him: it is the conſtant agreement of Antiquities, that <hi>Brittain</hi> now made by his death deſtitute not only of ſo worthy a King, but alſo of any certain heir or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of that Regal race, fell to inteſtine diſcord and variance, by which it was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afflicted long time upon that occaſion: a late Author tells us, <hi>King</hi> Lucius <hi>dyed without iſſue, by reaſon whereof after his deceaſe, the Brittains fell at variance, which continued about the ſpace of fifteen years, as</hi> Fabian <hi>thinketh, howbeit the old Engliſh Cronicle affirmeth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among them remained fifty years, though</hi> Harding <hi>affirmeth but four;</hi> which his words of <hi>Hardings</hi> opinion, that this variance among them continued but 4. years, are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for <hi>Harding</hi> ſetteth down the diſſenſions of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> as other Hiſtorians
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61256:77"/> do, and maketh them of as long continuance only, he ſaith that <hi>Severus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror came hither four years after the death of King <hi>Lucius</hi> to ſeek to appeaſe things, ſo doth <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter, Florentius</hi> and others as far as <hi>Harding</hi> doth.</p>
                        <p>This holy King, graunted, made and ſigned, many writings, Charters and Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the defence, maintainance and preſervation of Religion, and the chief teachers, and profeſſors thereof, as to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the School of <hi>Bangor,</hi> Monaſtery of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and ſuch others, and to every Archiepiſcopal or Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal See in <hi>Brittain,</hi> both for the aſſuring the old revenues and priviledges of the Archflamens and Flamens as others new and more ample, which he conferred unto them, and ſuch as ſhould ſit and ſucceed them for ever.</p>
                        <p>And we find in Antiquities, that in the very time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> beſides the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches in Great Cities, there were others alſo builded in them, as namely <hi>Gloceſter, Worceſter, Caerleon,</hi> and others; for we read of divers kinds of Churches in them all, both Cathedral and others: King <hi>Lucius</hi> was buried at <hi>Glocester</hi> in the Church of the Chief or firſt Order. The ſame diſtinction is given for <hi>Winchester,</hi> which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inferreth other Churches, or a Church in either of them of inferiour Order; for the word firſt proveth a ſecond; for the Inferiour Churches, beſides the Cathedral in <hi>Caerleon</hi> they are remembred in Hiſtories, (<hi>Viz.</hi> of St. <hi>Julius,</hi> and St. <hi>Aaron</hi>) ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities not inferiour unto theſe, <hi>Gloceſter</hi> being then but a new, and no great City: we find others, as at <hi>Abington</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire, Amsbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire, Cambridge, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and other places, where to have been Chriſtian Churches in that time, there is ſtill ſufficient teſtimony left us.<note place="margin">

                        <p>This his Charter of priviledges to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Antiquaries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of prove by divers Ancient Teſtimonies. The Bull of Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> 1000. years ago: the Charter of King <hi>Cadwalladrus,</hi> and King <hi>Arthur</hi> long before, wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that he granted to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as King <hi>Lucius</hi> with other Kings had done before, <hi>to be free from all publick Vectigalls, and burdens, that they might the more freely and quietly attend their ſtudies.</hi> The like I may affirm of <hi>Stanford,</hi> which from the time of King <hi>Bladud,</hi> untill it was interdicted by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> for the <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſie, continued an Univerſity, ſo of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> claiming but a little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter original, <hi>Greeklade</hi> and <hi>Liechlade</hi> of ſuch Antiquity, <hi>Belliſilum</hi> now <hi>Oxford</hi> as it pleadeth. Therefore whereas a late writer confidently ſayeth, there were 600. Students, in ancient times, and others not ſo well remembred; to all which now converted to the faith of Chriſt, and training up ſpiritual Soldiers for the defence, profeſſion and maintainance thereof, we have ſufficiently grounds to affirm, King <hi>Lucius</hi> gave the like priviledges as unto <hi>Cambridge,</hi> one and the ſame reaſon being for all, and yet beſides theſe, which he found founded before, he himſelf was founder of others, namely <hi>Bangor</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> which long continued in that State, untill it was after changed into ſo great a Monaſtery, that above 2000.

The M. S.

He ſlept very little by reaſon of his thin diet, and much buſineſs, wherewith he was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually occupied; for he thought that man who ſlept a whole night together, was no meet man to be either a Counſellour to a Prince or a Commander of an army. Every evening he uſed to write inſtructions upon twelve Tables made of <hi>Linden</hi> tree, which tables he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to one of his ſervants appointing him to carry them at ſundry hours of the night, to certain of his Souldies, who thereby ſuppoſing that their General was ſtill wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and not gone to bed, were the more careful in keeping the watch, and preventing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain attempts in the night ſeaſon: he was ſevere in execution of Juſtice, not to be led by favour, nor to be corrupted with bribe; he levied monies, only as neceſſary for the war, not to enrich himſelf or his friends, as other Governours in former times had done; for he never preferred his own private before the publick, nor a wealthy eſtate before an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable reputation. The fame of thoſe vertues as they made him much reſpected, both of his own Souldiers and the Brittains, ſo they procured Envy which alwaies followeth vertue inſeparably as a ſhadow doth the body. For <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperor underſtanding how <hi>Marcellus</hi> had carried himſelf in <hi>Brittain</hi> was much diſpleaſed therewith, and thought it beſt to cut him off: but ſome accidents happening in the mean time to make him change that purpoſe, he only ſent letters of diſcharge and ſo diſmiſſed him of the Office.</p>
                        <p>After departure of <hi>Marcellus</hi> the army having been kept in by hard hand, and finding now the reine let looſe, upon a ſuddain began to be mutinous, and refuſed to acknowledge <hi>Commodus</hi> for their Emperor; theſe diſorders <hi>Perennius</hi> one of his favorites took upon him to redreſſe, by diſplacing ſuch perſons as he ſuſpected, and committing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61256:78"/> their Offices to Men of meaner quality, wherewith the Legions were much diſcontented? diſdaining that inſtead of Senators, &amp; Men of conſular degree, they ſhould now be governed by upſtarts and baſe companions. In the heat of thoſe broyles, about fifteen ſoldiers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Army and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they exhibited to the Emperor, a bill of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt <hi>Perennius</hi> whom they charged as the chief Author of the diſſention in the Army, by bringing in new cuſtomes, by exceeding his commiſſion, and doing things derogatory to the Majeſty of the Roman Empire. Theſe and other things (as well falſe as true) were objected againſt him by the multitude, who for the moſt part diſlike ſuch as exerciſe authority over them, and keep no meaſure in their affections, either in love or hatred. But that which touched to the quick, was an accuſation of treaſon, put up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for conſpiracy againſt the life of the Emperor, and in ſeeking to advance his Son to the Empire: this point was quickly apprehended by <hi>Commodus</hi> who thought that the ſuſpicion of the fact, or the report only to have intended, it was a ſufficient cauſe of condemnation, howſoever the party accuſed was either indeed guilty or innocent. Hereupon <hi>Perennius</hi> was declared Traitor, and delivered to the Soldiers, who ſtripped him of his apparel, whipped him with rods, and in the end cruelly murdered him.</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>Helvius Pertinax</hi> (a Man of mean fortune by Birth, as having riſen from the State of a common Soldier to the dignity of a Commander) was ſent into <hi>Brittain</hi> to appeaſe the tumults there. He was one of them that <hi>Perennius</hi> had before diſcharged from bearing office, and ſent into <hi>Liguria</hi> where he was born. At his firſt entrance he attempted by force to ſuppreſs the rebellion of the army, adventuring ſo far in a skirmiſh, that though he eſcaped with life, yet was he left among the dead, and ſuppoſed to be ſlain. Afterwards proceeding with better advice and ſucceſs, he compoſed the troubles, ſeverely puniſhing the principal offendors, and uſing ſome rigour in revenging his own injuries, by which means growing odious to the Soldiers, and diſtruſting his own ſafety, he made ſuit to be diſcharged of the Lieutenantſhip.</p>
                        <p>Then was the government of the Province aſſigned to <hi>Clodius Albinus,</hi> a Man of Noble birth, very forward, and for the moſt part fortunate in his attempts, for which the Emperor <hi>Commodus,</hi> either upon fear or favour did honor him with the title of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> though <hi>Albinus</hi> ſeemed unwilling to accept it, and afterwards diſcovered his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition more openly in affecting the ancient free State. For upon a falſe report of the death of <hi>Commodus,</hi> he made an Oration to the Legions in <hi>Brittain,</hi> in favour of the Senate, whoſe Government he had commended, and preferred the ſame before that of Emperors. But <hi>Commodus</hi> being advertiſed thereof, ſent <hi>Junius Severus</hi> with all ſpeed to take charge of the army. This Emperor <hi>Commodus</hi> though he were a moſt wicked man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all that went before him in impiety,<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Bro.</hi> 247. 1.</note> as <hi>Marcus Maximus, Lampridius,</hi> and in them the whole Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> with others are witneſſes, yet as a ſcourge of God to the perſecutors of Chriſtians, he oppreſſed them, and was favourable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, never moleſting them, whether it was at the mediation of <hi>Marcia</hi> a Woman whom he exceedingly affected, and was as <hi>Dio</hi> ſaith, moſt friendly to Chriſtians, <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anorum ſtudioſiſſima,</hi> or otherwiſe, I do not examine; he remained Emperor all Pope <hi>Eluthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his time.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Albinus</hi> retired himſelf from affairs till <hi>Commodus</hi> was dead, and <hi>Pertinax</hi> elected Emperor, then he continued himſelf with <hi>Didius Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> whom the Soldiers (that then made open ſale of the Empire) had elected after the death of <hi>Pertinax.</hi> But <hi>Julianus</hi> being infamous for his Vices, and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perform his prom<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Then <hi>Severus</hi> made preparation for his voyage into <hi>Brittain,</hi> which by reaſon of the often change of Governors was grown much out of order, and although the <hi>Brittains</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intelligence of his purpoſe did ſend over Embaſſadors to offer their voluntary ſubmiſſion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61256:78"/> yet the Emperor in whom neither age nor ſickneſſe had abated the heat of ambition, would not directly accept thereof, but entertained them with delayes, till all things were in readineſſe for his expedition (ſo earneſt a deſire he had to paſſe into the furtheſt part of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and to purchaſe the ſirname of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> as an honourable addition to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther titles) his two ſons <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> commonly called <hi>Caracalla,</hi> and <hi>Getta,</hi> he took with him; as doubting their agreement in his abſcence.

Then <hi>Severus</hi> haſted into <hi>Calidonia,</hi> where finding the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages uncertain, and dangerous by reaſon of the Fens, Woods, and deep Waters he cauſed Trees to be felled, and Bridges and Cawſies to be made for his Souldiers to march over. The <hi>Calidonians</hi> in the mean time ſallied out of the woods, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were much encumbred for want of firme ground, and were often times forced to trace the Country, and to diſperſe themſelves into ſeveral companies, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places of advantage: by which means a great number of them periſhed, while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants (lying in ambuſh and ſometimes leaving their cattel abroad a train to draw them within danger) ſuddainly ſurpriſed and killed them, before they could recover their camp.

The conditions were, that the <hi>Calidonians</hi> ſhould firſt diſarme themſelves, and deliver part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (lying next the Province) into the <hi>Romans</hi> poſſeſſion, and that from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they ſhould attempt nothing againſt the publick peace; which articles agreed upon, and aſſurance taken for the performance, <hi>Severus</hi> retired himſelf into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, leaving his ſon <hi>Baſſianus</hi> to take charge of the army, which after the Emperors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture grew careleſſe and diſſolute; wherewith the General ſeemed nothing diſpleaſed, either for that he was by his own nature inclined to the worſt; or elſe for that he hoped thereby to win the Souldiers favour as a mean for his advancement to the Empire after his fathers death, which he had oftentimes attempted by indirect practiſes moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to procure.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while the <hi>Calidonians</hi> (notwithſtanding the late contract) underſtanding what diſorders were in that Roman camp, ſuddainly invaded it, killing and taking booty, which they ſhared with their Neighbours (borderers of the province) that had aſſiſted them in in the enterpriſe. <hi>Severus</hi> being greatly incenſed therewith, ſent part of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to purſue the <hi>Calidonians,</hi> expreſly commanding, that they ſhould be all put to the ſword, without reſpect of age or fex. This ſharp manner of proceeding, did ſomewhat quaile the hope of the Northren Brittains, who fled into remote parts of <hi>Calidonia;</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi> having rather ſtayed, then ended the troubles (as intending to proſecute the war with more advantage, ſpent ſome time in repairing and enlarging <hi>Adrians</hi> wall, which he carried thwart the Iſland from ſea to ſea, entrenching and fortifiing it, with Bulwarks and ſquare Towers, in places moſt convenient (to give warning one to another up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſuddain aſſault) for defence of the borders. Then being wearied with age, ſickneſs and travail,<note place="margin">York.</note> having his mind alſo much grieved with the diſloyal and unnatural practiſes of his ſon <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> he withdrew himſelf to <hi>Eboracum,</hi> a <hi>Colonie</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> being then the ſtation of the ſixt Legion called <hi>Victrix,</hi> and afterwards growing to be one of the chief places of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count among the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> for theſe ſtations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions were commonly the ſeed plots of towns and cities, both in this Iſle and divers other parts of the Empire.</p>
                        <p>It was reported that in his paſſage thither, a Moor with a Cypreſs Garland on his head, did meat and ſalute him by the name of a God, and at his entrance into the City, he was by error of the Southſayer (that guided him) brought into the Temple of <hi>Bellona,</hi> and that black beaſts being appointed for Sacrifice, did of themſelves follow him to his pallace. Theſe things howſoever thew fell out accidentally, yet they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61256:79"/> were interpreted as ominous in reſpect of the event, and now <hi>Severus</hi> perceiving his death to approach called before him ſome of his Councellors and chief Captains, unto whom he is ſaid to have ſpoaken in this manner.</p>
                        <p>It is now above eighteen years, ſince I was firſt declared Emperor by the army in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> during which time, with what care, pain, and travail <hi>I</hi> have weilded this vaſt body of the Empire, my continual employment in wars, both at home and abroad, may witneſs ſufficiently.

For neither multitude of men, nor abundance of treaſure, are ſo available to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Commonwealths, as amity and unity between Governors. For by concord we ſee that ſmall things grow to greatneſs, whereas by diſcord the greateſt fall to ruine. I muſt now leave to them (my Succeſſors) the imperial Diadem, that which <hi>Baſſianus</hi> hath ſo long thirſted after, though he know not yet, whether it be a thing to be wiſhed or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as having not proved the difference betwixt a Prince and a private perſon. But ambition mindes are carried blindfold, they know not whether, in deſiring that which having once obtained, they can neither keep without great care, nor leave without extream peril: ſuch a thing is Soveraignty, whoſe greatneſs is not contained in it ſelf, but conſiſteth for the moſt part in the opinion, and dependeth on the diſpoſitions of other men, it is vertue only not glorious titles, which makes men truly great. My ſelf at this preſent may ſerve for an example to ſhew upon what a weak foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, humane greatneſs is built. <hi>I have ſeen all things though now it avail me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> ſeeing I muſt pay my debt to nature, and after all my exploytes in the Eaſt and Weſt parts of the World, <hi>I</hi> muſt dye, as I may ſay, out of the World in a ſtrange Country, if any Country may be termed ſtrange to the Romans, who have now by conqueſt made all Countries their own; <hi>I</hi> exhort you therefore as you tender the welfare of the Roman Empire, of your own ſelves, of your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be true and faithfull to my ſons, as you have been to me, aſſiſting them with your Councel, and perſwading them to mutual concord, as the main pillar to ſupport, both their Eſtates and your own.</p>

                        <p>And after his coming into Brittain, we do not find the leaſt ſuſpition in our Antiquities, that he did of himſelf, or ſuffer any other to perſecute any for Chriſtian Religion; but rather both of himſelf, and at the inſtance of his Brittiſh Empreſs, at the leaſt a Chriſtian in affection and both powerable with him, and their ſon <hi>Baſſianus</hi> his heir and ſucceſſor, and for that love and truſt he found in the Brittiſh Chriſtians of all that part of Brittain.

He was after his death made a God among the Pagans: and <hi>Herodianus</hi> ſaith, he died rather of grief for his childrens wickedneſſe then of ſickneſſe, which grief for the ſins of his ſons, as alſo of his own in permitting the Chriſtians in many places be to moſt grievouſly perſecuted, I would not deny; but that he dyed in any ſuch grief is untrue, being moſt certain, that he after ſo many conqueſts in other Countries, when he came to fight againſt this Country Chriſtians, was enforced diſhonourably to make a wall and trench above 130 miles in length to keep his enemies back from invading him, and ſlain in battail by <hi>Fulgenius,</hi> or as others call him <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> brother to his firſt lawful true wife, the Empreſs <hi>Martia</hi> a <hi>Brittain.</hi> And by the Roman writers themſelves, he was at this time when he was ſlain at <hi>Yorke</hi> 65 years old.

                           <hi>Baſſianus</hi> being advertiſed of his fathers death, practiſed with the Souldiers, by bribes and fair promiſes, that he might be declared ſole Emperour, whereto when he could not perſwade them, for the reverence they bare to his father <hi>Severus,</hi> he made a league with the Northern <hi>Brittains</hi> that then aſſailed the Borders, and returned to <hi>York</hi> to meet with <hi>Julia</hi> the Empreſſe his mother in law, and <hi>Geta</hi> his brother. There he cauſed the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be put to death, for not ridding his father ſooner out of the way, as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, then he appointed ſecretly to the ſlaughter, all thoſe that for their vertue and wiſdom had been eſteemed and advanced by his father; and all ſuch as having been Tutors to him and his brother, and adviſed them to mutual concord. This done he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into conſultation about his fathers funerals, which were ſolemnized by the Army with all due rights, according to the ancient cuſtome in time of war. The aſhes of the dead body being put into a golden Urne, were afterwards by <hi>Julia</hi> the Empreſſe, accompanied with the two <hi>Cæſars,</hi> carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Severus</hi> after the uſuall ceremony was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated a God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Severus</hi> left as is related two ſons <hi>Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Geta,</hi> and if <hi>Fulgenius,</hi> who is by divers called King (though indeed he was only <hi>Dux populi</hi>) had any right by deſcent to the Crown of <hi>Brittain,</hi> ſeeing we read of no child or brother he left behind him, that the title which he claimed muſt needs deſcend to the eldeſt ſon of <hi>Severus,</hi> which was <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> ſon alſo to the ſiſter of <hi>Fulgenius,</hi> as ſome before have written; now having by the death of his Father <hi>Severus</hi> and Uncle <hi>Fulgenius</hi> both their titles, with the allowance of the Empreſs <hi>Martia</hi> his mother, lawfully inveſted in him.</p>

And being but ſeven years old, hearing that one of his Chriſtian Play-fellowes was grievouſly beaten for that his Religion, as the common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is, he could not long after endure the Procures of his beating. And in this hope of the Brittains, now Chriſtians, that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> would rather be a friend then perſecutor of ſuch, they were not deceived. For although contrary to his firſt education when he was with Chriſtians, being ſeparated from them he fell to ſo many kinds of impieties, as writers do report, and put innumerable of the Pagan Roman Nobles to death, and many of them which had been greateſt enemies to Chriſtians; yet he died innocent from Chriſtian blood and perſecution,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Br.</hi> 371.</note> and by his ſevere puniſhment towards their adverſaries was juſtly interpreted to be a revenger of their wrongs and former calamities. The common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that he reigned between ſix and ſeven years; although I find in an old Manuſcript French Hiſtory, entreating much of the affairs of this Kingdom, written above 400 years ſince, that he was King of <hi>Brittain</hi> 29. years, <hi>Baſſian tenoit le Roilme d Brittanie</hi> 29. <hi>ans.</hi>

                           </note>In this Emperours time St. <hi>Zepherine</hi> was Pope, who converted our renowned countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> who won by his preaching, life, and death, after ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of this Nation to Chriſt, of whom a late Authour citing divers antiquities, thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, St. <hi>Amphibalus being a noble young man of</hi> Brittain, <hi>and going to</hi> Rome <hi>with</hi> Baſſianus <hi>ſon to</hi> Severus, <hi>was there by Pope</hi> Zepherinus <hi>inſtructed ſecretly in the Christian faith, baptiſed, made Priest, and ſent back into Brittain, there to preach unto others.</hi> Neither may we with prudence judge, that ſo great a concourſe of our Brittiſh Nation and Nobility being then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> thus converted (a great Noble Man, and termed in antiquities the ſon of a Prince, and ſo not without attendance) that he alone was thus converted, and employed by that holy Pope at this time, and not unprobable but ſome of thoſe holy Apoſtolick men which are yet remembred in Hiſtories, to have aſſiſted St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibalus</hi> afterward in preaching Chriſt in theſe parts or received their Ordination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the ſame at <hi>Rome</hi> now about this time; ſuch as were <hi>Modicus, Priſcus, Calanus, Ferranus, Ambianus,</hi> and <hi>Carnocus:</hi> there is no repugnancy in the time, for theſe were old men when the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> raged here, and St. <hi>Alban</hi> was martyred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jacobus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Genua,</hi> and ſo to be termed of that City in <hi>Italy,</hi> a Roman writer, writing fourſcore years, or thereabouts, before <hi>Matthew Weſt,</hi> (who calls this Saint <hi>Clericus</hi> only, not expreſſing his name) teſtifies that his name was <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> a <hi>Brittain</hi> of this Kingdom, and ſon to a Prince thereof, relating his Hiſtory and life at large. But our Monck might without blame be ignorant of that Author. And this forreign biſhop addeth, that he went from hence to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Severus,</hi> and was there Knighted amongſt that noble company, moſt part of this Nation, recounted in number 1540. of which St. <hi>Alban</hi> was alſo one; and that St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> was there made prieſt by the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent home into his Country. <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> ſaith, he was borne as <hi>Caerlegeon,</hi> the renowned City and School in <hi>Wales.</hi> So have divers others: the old manuſcript Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> ſaith, he was an holy Monck, and Doctour in the Church of <hi>Caermardyn</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi> And this is the laſt certain place of his Reſidency, which that Antiquity giveth him, before his perſecution, and going to the <hi>Scots;</hi> and ſo it ſeemeth not unprobable, but he was alſo Biſhop of that city <hi>Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> or without queſtion, of ſome other City there; for otherwiſe how could he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Biſhop among the <hi>Scots,</hi> by whoſe Annals he is accounted the firſt Biſhop they had reſident among them, but more of him hereafter.</p>
                        <p>About the year of our Lord 220. or a little before, <hi>Baſſianus</hi> Emperour and King of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, was murdered between <hi>Ediſſa</hi> and <hi>Carras,</hi> by <hi>Mardianus</hi> a Centurion: he marrying with the ſiſter of the holy chriſtian Lady <hi>Mammea,</hi> left their ſon <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> behind him, who ſoon after was Emperour. An old French Manuſcript Hiſtory ſaith, that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> was ſlain by <hi>Carauſius,</hi> who after reigned 38 years. The ſame hath the manuſcript com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation in theſe words, <hi>Et tandem faventibus Britonnibus</hi> Carauſius <hi>demicavit cum</hi> Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiano, <hi>&amp; interfecit eum, &amp; ſic gubernaculum regni in ſeſe ſuſcepit;</hi> of this opinion alſo is <hi>Fabian.</hi>

                           <hi>Howes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Baſſianus</hi> was cruelly given to ſenſuality and luſt, inſomuch that he eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his mother-in-law <hi>Juba,</hi> others call her <hi>Julia,</hi> as <hi>Hollenſhed; Fabian Juliana;</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>Baſſianus</hi> on a certain time breaking in to his brother <hi>Geta</hi>'s chamber, ſlew him even in his mothers lap, and that himſelf was after ſlain at <hi>Ediſsa</hi> by one of his ſouldiers (but names him not) as he was about to untruſs his points.</p>
                        <p>Now the affairs of <hi>Brittain,</hi> for the ſpace of almoſt fifty years together were paſſed over in ſilence, as being either omitted through negligence of Writers in that age, or periſhing through the calamity of the times that enſued under the Emperours following, namely, <hi>Popilius Macrinus</hi> (the ſucceſſor of <hi>Baſſianus) Varus Heliogobalus, Alexander Severus, Maximinus Gordianus</hi> the firſt, ſecond and third, <hi>Philippus Arats, Decius Valerianus:</hi> Theſe are the words of the Authour of the Brittiſh Hiſtory; but we will leave him a while, to try what other Authours ſay; <hi>Fabian</hi> tells, that <hi>Carauſius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61256:85"/> they did eſteem him their great enemy, and as for ſuch an one rejoyced at his death, and this joy was not onely of particular Romans, but of the whole Senate which ruled chiefly in matters of Eſtate. Therefore when our Antiquities aſſure us that <hi>Coel</hi> obtained the Kingdom, and was crowned, and as an old French manuſcript ſpeaketh, <hi>regna ſur Britaniae,</hi> ruleth over Brittain, and was thus inabled and made power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to redreſſe what he found offenſive and wicked, being abſolute King, and joyfully ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> as our Hiſtorian ſaid before.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Wherefore Brittains were all full glad and faine,</l>

                        </q>
                        <p>And he himſelf taking acception to <hi>Aſclepiodotus,</hi> next to his charging him with uſurping the Crown, for being to backward in reſiſting the Roman perſecutors, would not fall into the like error with him, but as is proved already <hi>ſuccoured all their pain,</hi> and utterly ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perſecution againſt Chriſtians of Brittain which were thus joyful of his coronation and thereby relieved and redeemed them from their afflictions all his time, which both by our own and forreign Hiſtorians, continued to the end of the third hundred of years.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Broughton.</hi>
                           </note> The <hi>Romans</hi> having no power here either to perſecute Chriſtians, or to any other purpoſe. But as our Brittiſh and other Hiſtorians teſtify, wholly loſt their government here, untill after the death of King <hi>Coel,</hi> or the comming of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> his ſon in law hither, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, very little before King <hi>Coel</hi> his death. Our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Hiſtorians ſay that King <hi>Coel</hi> utterly deſtroyed both <hi>Romans</hi> and all the <hi>Brittains</hi> alſo, which were their favourers, and ſet forth a ſevere edict, to ſearch forth all <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Brittains</hi> which had followed them here, and cauſed them to be puniſhed and put to death, and ſo with moſt joyful and general applauſe of the people, Nobles and others, that the crown of <hi>Brittain</hi> was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the true heir of their regal blood, was crowned King, and he eſtabliſhed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Brittiſh government. So that now ſo ſevere a law being made and executed both againſt the proſecuting <hi>Romans,</hi> and all ſuch <hi>Brittains</hi> as had joyned with them againſt the Chriſtian inhabitants of this nation, and all this done by the authority of our King, and with the conſent both of the nobility and people; we muſt needs end the perſecution here with the beginning of King <hi>Coels</hi> reign.</p>
                        <p>And it would not be ſingular in this point if we ſhould hold, that King <hi>Coel</hi> was actually a chriſtian, and not only a friend to ſuch; for firſt, all they which affirm him to have been Kinſman or Heir to our firſt chriſtian King St. <hi>Lucius,</hi> eaſily prove him a chriſtian, for ſuch a man would not leave either child or kinſman, which by him had that title, to have any other education. Secondly by the time of his age, whether he was to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> ſo near or no we muſt needs confeſſe, he lived moſt part of his life, when chriſtianity flouriſhed in this Kingdom, being an aged man before <hi>Diocleſian</hi> his perſecution began. Thirdly our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians ſay that his daughter St. <hi>Helen,</hi> which had her education by his direction, was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and taught in the chriſtian faith. A late Authour thus ſpeaketh, of this, Helena <hi>ſhe was firſt inſtructed in the faith of Chriſt by</hi> Coel <hi>her father, as</hi> Petrus de Natalibus <hi>ſaith;</hi> and yet if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to this opinion, we may eaſily anſwer them that will object the public and univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of chriſtian religion, as building Churches, Monaſteries, and ſuch holy foundations was not in his time. For by the common opinion his reign was ſhort, little, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four years, a great part whereof was ſpent, in extirpating the perſecutors, and the reſt in preparation to reſiſt a new invaſion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not reigning in quiet and ſecurity from theſe troubles and fears the ſpace of two moneths, by any writers: and ſo after ſo great and terrible a tempeſt of perſecution, it was a wonderful comfort and happineſs for the Brittiſh chriſtians, to enter into ſuch a calme and quiet, to live in ſecurity and reſt, freed from their former miſeries under ſo renowned a King which was all he could do, or they expect in ſuch times and circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>The Roman Emperours after the death of <hi>Heliogabolus,</hi> until <hi>Conſtantius</hi> married firſt, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter received again <hi>Helena</hi> daughter of <hi>Coel,</hi> had little command in this Kingdom, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will ſuffice to ſet down briefly their names &amp; continuance of their Emperours, which our late Antiquaries do thus propoſe unto us.

St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayers all the night following, a ſtrange and admirable viſion appeared to <hi>Alban,</hi> wherewith he being exceedingly terrified and perplexed, preſently roſe and went to St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> thus declaring his viſion, and deſiring the expoſition thereof in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and theſe words. <hi>O my friend if theſe things which thou preacheſt of Chriſt are true. I beſeech thee be not afraid to tell unto me the true meaning of my dream or viſion. I did attend and behold a Man came from Heaven, whom a great and innumerable multitude of Men apprehended, and laid divers kinds of Torments upon him, his hands were bound with cords, his body worne with whips, and grievouſly torne, his body hanged upon a croſs, and his hands ſtretched croſs upon it. The Man which was thus tortured, was naked and had no ſhoes upon his feet. His hands and feet were pierced with nails, his ſide thrust through with a ſpear, and as it ſeemed to me blood and water did flow out of the wound of his ſide; they ſet a reed in his right hand, and put a crown of thorne upon his head, and having done all things which mans cruelty could work againſt him, they began to work him with words, ſaying unto him, Hail King of the Jewes: If thou art the ſon of God, now come down from thy croſs and we believe thee, and then they uſed many revilings againſt him: that younge man anſwered not one word unto them. At last when they had ſaid what they could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, crying out with a great voice he ſayed. O Father into thy hands I commend my ſpirit, and having ſo ſaid gave up the Ghoſt. His dead body was taken down from the croſs, the blood still largely iſſuing out of his wounds, they ſhut it in a tomb of ſtone, and covered it with a ſtone ſealed, appointing watchmen to keep it. And a wonder to ſee, his body thus being dead came to life again, and receiving strength, did go forth of the Sepulchre, it still remaining ſhut. How he did aroſe from death, I did behold with my own eyes. Men cloathed with garments as white as ſnow did come from Heaven, and taking that Man with them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from whence they came, and an infinite army of Men cloathed all in white doth follow him, which ceaſed not in all that journey, to ſing prayſes, and continually bleſſed a Father and his only begotten ſon, great and unſpeakable joy was among them, ſo that none might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily be compared unto it. Theſe and many other things which I neither will, nor is lawfull for any mortal Man to tell have been ſhewed to me in viſion this night, what they do ſignifie, I beſeech thee not to conceal from me; be not afraid.</hi> St. Amphibalus, <hi>hearing theſe things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that his heart was viſited by God, exceedingly rejoyced in our Lord, and forthwith pulling out a croſs of our Lord which he had about him, ſaid behold, in this ſign thou maiest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſee what this viſion this night meaneth, what it ſignifieth. For this Man coming from Heaven is my Lord Jeſus Christ, who did not refuſe to undergo the puniſhment of the Croſs, that he might deliver us by his blood from the guilt, wherewith we were held bound by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication of our firſt parent Adam.</hi> And ſo proſecuting to the myſtery of the holy Trinity, which I need not particularly to relate, writing to Chriſtian Readers, to ſpeak in this old Brittiſh Authors words again; <hi>Alban</hi> greatly marvailing upon the ſpeeches of St. <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> brake out into theſe words. The things which thou relateſt of Chriſt are true, and cannot in any reſpect be reproved as falſe, for I this night have evidently known, how Chriſt overcame the Divel, and thruſt him down to the bottom of Hell. I have ſeen with my eyes how that horrible one, lyeth enwrapped, in the knots of chains, hereby knowing that all thou haſt ſpoken is true. I believe and from this time this is my faith, that there is no God but my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who for the ſalutation of Men, vouchſaving to take humanity upon him ſuſtained the paſſion of the croſs, the which the Father and the Holy Ghoſt is one God, and there is no other, and having thus ſaid, he falleth down proſtrate before the croſs, as if he had ſeen our Lord Jeſus hanging thereon, the bleſſed penitent craveth pardon for his ſin. Tears mingled with blood, run down about his face, and in great quantity fell down upon the venerable wood of the croſs. I ſaith he, renounce the Devil, and deteſt all the Enemies of Chriſt, believing in him, and commending my ſelf to him, who as thou affirmeth roſe the third day from death. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> ſaith unto him be of courage, our Lord is with thee, and his grace

That faith which other mortal men have deſerved to receive by the Tradition of Men, thou haſt not learned it either of Man or by Man, but by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Jeſus Chriſt.

                        <p>Great is the honour which our own both <hi>Brittiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories, and alſo forraign yield to the Souldier (untill then Pagan) who being one that led St. <hi>Alban</hi> to his martyrdom and converted by his miracles by the way, was then and there alſo moſt cruelly martyred. St. <hi>Gildas</hi> ſaith, this martyr being converted by the miracles St. <hi>Alban</hi> ſhewed, when by his prayers the deep river gave place to him, and a thouſand with him, to paſſe over, not wetting their feet, the waters on both ſides ſtanding like walls, as they did to the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> to give them paſſage, was of a wolfe made a lamb, and did both vehemently deſire, and valiantly endure martyrdom with him. St. <hi>Bede</hi> relateth this Hiſtory in like manner, yet with more Emphaſis of his glory, for having ſpoken of the ſame ſtrange miracle, by which this Souldier was converted calling him <hi>Carnifex,</hi> the deſigned executioner to put St. <hi>Alban</hi> to death, as <hi>S. Gildas</hi> and others do, to ſhew how wonderfully the grace of Chriſt wrought in him, he addeth, that by divine Inſpiration he made all ſpeed he could to come to St. <hi>Alban,</hi> and caſting away his ſword that was drawn to behead St. <hi>Alban,</hi> proſtrated himſelf before his feet, the whole aſſembly beholding it, greatly deſiring that he himſelf might be worthy to be put to death with the martyr which he was commanded to ſtrike, and ſo of a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor he became a companion in Truth and faith.</p>
                        <p>This St. <hi>Heraclius</hi> (for ſo was this happy ſouldier called) having reſolutely denyed his Paganiſme, craved pardon for his error, and confeſſed Chriſt openly before ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, and in the higheſt of their malice and rage againſt St. <hi>Alban,</hi> fell thereby into the ſame degree of hatred with them, for preſently thereupon to ſpeak in an old Authors words, <hi>The Enemies of truth apprehended him, beat out his teeth, rent his holy mouth, and brake all his bones, and although nothing remained in his body without hurt,</hi>

And apprehending him with horrible torment, they tare his holy body in pieces, and lastly cut off his head. And ſo this happy Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, perſevering in the faith of Chriſt, together with St.</hi> Alban, <hi>deſerved to be honoured with the crown of martydom.</hi>

And thus reſting themſelves, only St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> reſted not, but preached continually the doctrine of ſalvation to his enemies, who in the mean time gave notice to the Prince, and thoſe of the City of their return and bringing with them the inſtructor of St. <hi>Alban,</hi> and that they had put all thoſe Chriſtians before ſpoken of to death, in the uttermoſt parts of the Kingdom, after their long journey thither; which when the Governour heard, he called the people together, and exhorted them: Let us all go forth, and meet our enemy, that he that hath offended may receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of us all. And ſo haſting forth, ſtriving as it were who ſhould go firſt, went by the way leading to the North, as our antiquities ſay, the better to ſet down the old place and ſituation of that antient City, which they then left almoſt vacant. And coming in this raging madneſſe and multitude to torment and Martyr this holy Saint, they find him all wrapped in chains and bonds, and preſently ſtripped him naked, ſlit his belly, and pulled out his entrails, tying them to a ſtake, which they had faſtned in the ground, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to be led round about it.

                        <p>Which ſavage Edict the Pagan Souldiers effected, and killed a thouſand; which St. <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus</hi> beholding, and commending their ſouls to God, perſwaded his perſecutors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their errors, and be converted to Chriſt, without whom no ſalvation can be had, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hell and eternal damnation to be expected. But the perſecutors did ſtill perſevere in their impiety, not ceaſing ſo to torment this holy Saint with cruel ſtoning him, beſides ſo many tortures before remembred, that when his body was afterward miraculouſly found,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61256:89"/> there was not one whole bone in it. Although it ſeemeth by the Hiſtory of his life, that many of his bones were broken with ſtones by thoſe ſo enraged perſecutors, that after his bleſſed Soul was ſeparated from his body, thus lying ſtill bound and tied, they ceaſed not to break it more with their caſting great ſtones upon it. But ſo long as he lived in ſo great extremity of torments, although the ſtones were caſt at him as thick as hail (as ſome write) he ſtill perſevered in prayer, never moving himſelf on the one ſide or other. And being now come to the period of his puniſhments, and to yield his Soul to God: looking toward Heaven as another St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> he ſaw Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of his Father, and heard a conſort of Angels in Heaven, and among them knew St. <hi>Alban,</hi> whom he invocated to aſſiſt him, ſaying, O holy <hi>Alban,</hi> pray unto our God that he will ſend a good Angel to meet me, that the dreadful Robber lead me not, nor the wicked part hinder me in my journey. And a voice ſpake to him from Heaven in the hearing of all, in this manner, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto thee, this day thou ſhalt be with thy Diſciple Alban in Paradiſe.</hi> And two Angels ſhining with an heavenly brightneſs came down unto him, and taking with them the Soul of the bleſſed, reſplendent with a wonderful whiteneſs, with Hymnes and Praiſes carried it to Heaven; which done, to make him both glorious there and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable on earth, a Chriſtian ſecretly conveying his body, reverently buried it.</p>
                        <p>And God himſelf began now to honour him here, and be revenged upon his Enemies and Perſecutors. Thoſe lips of theirs which had been opened before to blaſpheme towards God, and revilings towards his holy Saints, are now miraculouſly drawn away, that their ſpeech is hindred. The tongues which had ſo abuſed him, now burn; and the faces of them which had ſo deformed him, were made deformed; all their members are ſo ſtiff, that the ſtoners and tormentors of this holy man, could not now lift one ſtone from the ground; and the Judge or Prince himſelf loſing his underſtanding of reaſon, became mad; and how many ſoever had lifted up their hands againſt our Lord, did of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive due revenge for their demerits. Hereupon the whole City received the Faith of Chriſt, and deſired to be Baptized; and many by the inſpiration of God forſaking their goods, go to <hi>Rome</hi> to bewail their ſins, and confeſs their errours. With St. <hi>Amphibalus</hi> nine other Chriſtians were martyred, as <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> writeth; neither is it probable,<note place="margin">

And further ſaith, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the true Son and heir of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and by that title ſucceeded him in the Kingdom and Empire, which could not be truly ſaid, if <hi>Helen</hi> had not been his lawfull wife; neither could <hi>Conſtantius</hi> by this learned and holy Author be named a Religious Father, if he had not begot his Son lawfully in true marriage. And St. <hi>Bede</hi> confeſſeth from <hi>Eutropius,</hi> that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſucceeded his Father in the Kingdom of <hi>Brittain,</hi> and ſo by him alſo muſt needs be his lawfull ſon, <hi>Florenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Wigorn</hi> writeth in the ſame manner, and confeſſeth St. <hi>Helen</hi> to have been here in <hi>Brittain</hi> long after her ſon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was Emperor, yet theſe be the chiefeſt Authors that in any ſenſe have termed St. <hi>Helen</hi> by that name.</p>
                        <p>It is evident by all hiſtories, not only of Chriſtians, that St. <hi>Helen</hi> was a moſt chaſt and holy Woman, and that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> alſo lived in conjugal chaſtity, marrying when he was but young, but alſo even by the Pagan writers themſelves, as witneſſeth <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanus</hi> the Orator that lived in this time, in his publick oration to his ſon <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and others; therefore St. <hi>Helen</hi> being the firſt woman, that was thus wedded unto him in marriage, ſhe muſt needs be his true lawfull wife by their own teſtimonies. And the ſame Author witneſſeth before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at the publick ſolemnity of his marriage with <hi>Fausta,</hi> in moſt plain and expreſs words that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was born in <hi>Brittain,</hi> ſo teſtifie divers Authors even of the Roman Hiſtory, among whom one plainly ſaith, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the lawfull ſon of <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Helen,</hi> and born in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and that his Father <hi>Constantius</hi> was compelled by <hi>Herculius</hi> the Emperour to be divorced from <hi>Helen</hi> his true wife, to take <hi>Theodora</hi> Daughter in Law of that Emperor. <hi>Eutropius</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was ſon of <hi>Constantius</hi> in true marriage: <hi>Conſtantinus Manaſſes</hi> ſaith, St. <hi>Helen</hi> was the wife of <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> and a moſt bleſſed Woman. <hi>Hunibaldus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1000. years ſince, relateth the Hiſtory of the compoſition between <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and our Brittiſh King <hi>Coel,</hi> as our writers do.

                           </note> and to free her from all ſlanders, the chamber of her heart and ſoul was far more pure; in all things ſhe was obedient to the will of God, and yet externally plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to her husband <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> although more pleaſing to God then to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee how far this moſt bleſſed and noble Queen and Empreſſe,<note place="margin">Bernigoſus ibid.</note> was in all times from being baſe, either by birth or converſation, ſuch ſanctify of life could never agree with that foule name, by which ſome have ſo wrongfully termed her; ſuch parentage, Pallaces and Revenues, able to entertain the greateſt Princes according to their ſtate and dignity, muſt denominate their noble owners with better termes and attributes.

It ſeemeth this Pallace and lands in and about <hi>Trevers</hi> to have deſcended to St. <hi>Helen</hi> by her mother, or ſome Anceſtour of that Country, for both <hi>Beringoſus</hi> ſaith, St. <hi>Helen</hi> was brought up at <hi>Trevers;</hi> and <hi>Otho Frigenſis</hi> ſaith, ſhe was by ſome of her Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours come from thence.

This is confirmed by the number of Weſtern Biſhops above 400, as <hi>Sozomen</hi> and others write, aſſembled at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 160 from the Eaſt at the ſame time, gathered together at <hi>Seleucia</hi> in <hi>Iſauria,</hi> when it is manifeſt in the old Manuſcript Catalogue of Biſhops, that <hi>Brittain</hi> and all the Weſtern Nations preſent in the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> had not at that time many more than 400 Biſhops. Therefore we muſt needs grant, that the Biſhops of all Cities as well of <hi>Brittain</hi> as other Countries of the Weſt, which had not excuſeable lets and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, were there preſent in ſuch ſence as the Epiſtle of that Councel is cited,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61256:98"/> and <hi>Severus Sulpitius</hi> is ſufficient witneſſe, that this our <hi>Brittain</hi> in particular, that it had many Biſhops there, for relating the number to have been above 400 out of the Weſt: And the Emperour the better to incline them to the <hi>Arian</hi> hereſie as it ſeemeth, commandeth that proviſion ſhould be made for them at his coſt; But the Biſhops of <hi>France, Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>Brittain</hi> refuſed it, and rather made choice to live at their own charges than to be maintained by the Emperour; and this refuſal was general to all the Biſhops of <hi>Brittain, Aquitaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> except three only of <hi>Brittain,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived allowance from the Emperour, and refuſed maintenance by the other Biſhops, themſelves being poor.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame Authors prove, that our Biſhops were drawn or forced to come to that Councel by the Officers of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> now after his brothers death, a profeſſed friend to the <hi>Arian</hi> hereſie; or rather a profeſſed <hi>Arian</hi> then reigning in <hi>Brittain</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it evident, that our Brittiſh Biſhops, which could not plead ſufficient cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and abſence, were generally preſent there.

So that we ſee no excuſe, but infirmity either by age or ſickneſſe to have cauſed any <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops abſence thence. A late writer thinketh <hi>Iltutus</hi> then, as he conjectureth, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gaerleon,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi>

And the Councel of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> it ſelf in the Epiſtle to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour, teſtifieth plainly, that all the Biſhops of the Weſt were there aſſembled. The far greater part of theſe were Catholick Biſhops, and of the whole number about 400. There was not by <hi>Severus Sulpilius</hi> his relation above 80. <hi>Arians.</hi> St. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſaith, there were 50 and more, and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> witneſſeth, that the greateſt part of the Biſhops there confirmed the faith of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, and condemned the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> errors. This is teſtified by the ſame Councel in two ſeveral Epiſtles to the Emperor, that they neither could nor would ſwerve from the doctrine of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
                        <p>And although the Emperour both by his Epiſtle to that Councel, and otherwiſe by fraud and terrours, endeavoured for to remove them from that holy minde, and communicate with the <hi>Arians,</hi> they plainly wrote anſwer again, conſtantly averring they would change nothing they had decreed, and gave their Legates charge to tell him as much in words: And to make it manifeſt, that although by many Writers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Biſhops being convented and overcome, both with the deceit of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and perſecution of the Emperour, did afterward ſubſcribe to a material error, our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Brittain</hi> were free, both from imputation and ſuſpition thereof. <hi>Socrates, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen, Nicephorus</hi> and others prove that the Emperour neglecting to return anſwer to the ſecond abſolute reſolution and Epiſtle, the Councel ſtaying ſome time for anſwer, and having none, they all departed to their countries, and Sees,<note place="margin">Hil. li. contra Arian. &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.

                        </p>
                        <p>It pleaſed our Lord that theſe ſhips lancing out of the Haven met with a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind, which inſtead of carrying that bleſſed company towards <hi>Brittaine,</hi> it furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly carried them quite contrary, and paſſing by <hi>Zeland</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> drove them into the mouth of the River of <hi>Rhene,</hi> a River of great capacity and depth, and carried them ſo high as the water did ebb and flow.

                        <p>Yet to free our Kingdom of <hi>Brittain</hi> &amp; <hi>Wales</hi> alſo of giving life to ſuch a man, St. <hi>Hier.</hi> ſaith he was by nation a <hi>Scot,</hi> as <hi>Iſidore Peluſiota</hi> noteth, and alſo a voluptuous Monk, both which may be reconciled, if we ſay he was born among the <hi>Scots,</hi> and bred in our great Monaſtery of <hi>Bangor</hi> and there long time a holy Monk, but after falling both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hereſie and lewdneſſe of life, he was often condemned in divers Councels in <hi>Aſia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> whether he had ſpread his hereſies, but not perfectly untill the time of Pope <hi>Zoſimus</hi> about the year of Chriſt 418 being by him finally condemned, both he and his followers were driven into exile by <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperor, and that hereſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in all the World; This <hi>Pelagius,</hi> though he had many followers, yet were they all ſtrangers, for the great honour to this Nation, that it had ſuch learned men, that even one of them falling into error did ſo much prevail and dilate it both in <hi>Europe, Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and yet in his own Country could nothing prevail, but was at the firſt convinced, rejected and exiled, and did only indeavour to infect <hi>Brittain</hi> his native Country, but could not effect his deſire therein.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Romans</hi> about four hundred and ſeventy yeares after their firſt enterance into this Iſle waxed weary of the Government of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Brittains,</hi> that had been many times aſſailed by their uncivil neighbours (conſorted with ſtrangers of divers Nations) perceived themſelves unable to make reſiſtance, as in the former times; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent Embaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> requiring aid, and promiſing fealty, if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> would reſcue them from the oppreſſion of their enemies. Then was there a Legion ſent over into the Iſland to expulſe the barbarous people out of the province, which being with good ſucceſſe effected, the <hi>Romans</hi> counſelled the <hi>Brittaines</hi> for their better defence to make a ſtone wall betwixt<note n="*" place="margin">The firth of <hi>Dunbretton</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi>

                        <p>Upon the complaint and earneſt ſollicitation of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> there was another Legion ſent over by <hi>Aetius</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Gallia,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to aid the diſtreſſed <hi>Brittains,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> having reduced the Povince into her former ſtate, did tell the <hi>Brittains,</hi> that it was not for their eaſe to take any more ſuch long Journies, being coſtly and paineful, conſidering that the Empire it ſelf was aſſailed, and in a manner overrunne by Strangers; and therefore that from thenceforth they ſhould provide for their own ſafety, that they ſhould learn to uſe Armour and Weapons, and truſt to their own valour.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61256:102"/> Howbeit the Romans (in regard of the good ſervice done by the Brittiſh Nation in former times) began to build a Wall of Stone from Eaſt to Weſt, in the ſelf ſame place where <hi>Severi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as they were gone, the barbarous people having intelligence thereof, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed confidently, that without any great aſſiſtance they might now enter the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: and thereupon accounting as their own whatſoever was without the Wall, they gave an aſſault to the Wall it ſelf, and with Graples, and ſuch like Engines, pulled down to the ground a great part thereof, while the <hi>Brittains</hi> inhabiting the borders being awaked with the ſuddenneſs of the Enterpriſe, gave warning to the reſt of their Countreymen within the Land to arm themſelves with ſpeed, and to make reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>About this time alſo, which was about the year of our Redemption 430, the ſtate of the Church in <hi>Brittain</hi> was much incumbred by the Hereſie of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> (of which a little before, yet I here again repeat it in another Authors Language, for fuller ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of my Reader) which being by birth a <hi>Brittain,</hi> by profeſſion a Monk, and as ſome think, trained up in the Monaſtery of <hi>Bangor,</hi> travelled firſt into <hi>Italy,</hi>

Howbeit, ſome of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> diſliking thoſe heretical Opinions, which as yet they were unable by knowledge in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to confute; and perceiving withal what dangerous inconveniences to the State aroſe oft times by reaſon of their diſagreement one from another in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, earneſtly required the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> to ſend over ſome godly, wiſe, and learned men, that might defend the truth of Chriſtianity, which ſeemed to be born down by the ſubtil allegations of humane Reaſon. Hereupon the Biſhops called a Synod, wherein <hi>Germanus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troyes</hi> in <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne</hi> were appointed to go into <hi>Brittain,</hi> and to undertake the Cauſe; which they afterwards proſecuted with ſo good ſucceſs, as many Hereticks among the <hi>Brittains</hi> were openly convinced, and Chriſtians confirmed in faith. About the ſame time <hi>Ninianus Bernitius</hi> (of the Race of the Brittiſh Princes) was ſent into <hi>Pictland</hi> to convert the Inhabitants there to Chriſtianity:<note place="margin">Brittiſh Hiſt. <hi>l.</hi> 3. f. 153.</note> 
                           <hi>Palladius</hi> a Grecian was likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to Preach the Goſpel in <hi>Scotland</hi> unto ſuch there as yet remained in Infidelity, and to ſuppreſs the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie new ſprung up in that Kingdom, to be the firſt and chief Biſhop of the Church there; for which purpoſe alſo <hi>Patricius,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Magonius,</hi> (born in <hi>Brittain</hi>) was ſent to the Iriſh and Scotch men that then dwelt in the Iſles of the <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Hebrides:</hi> theſe three Religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were much honoured in thoſe dayes, for the reverend opinion which moſt men had of their Learning and Integrity of life, and they are accounted the Apoſtles and Patrons of the Scotiſh, Iriſh, and Pictiſh Nations, as being the ſeveral Inſtruments of the general Converſion of each of them.</p>
                        <p>Within few years after the Brittains were again hotly purſued by the Scotchmen and Picts, who ſwarmed over a great part of the Land, taking from the Brittains for a time all opportunities of convening and aſſembling themſelves together, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dangers they had been accuſtomed; whereby no ſmall number of the Inhabitants of the Province (diſpairing of better ſucceſs) retired themſelves, giving way unto the preſent neceſſity, while each man (as in common calamities oft times it falleth out) laying aſide the care of the publick, made proviſion for his own ſafety, leaving the Enemy in the mean time to take and kill ſuch as reſiſted.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Brittains being driven out of their own houſes and poſſeſſions, fell to robbing one another, encreaſing their outward troubles with inward tumult and civil diſſention, by which means a great number of them had nothing left to ſuſtain them but what they got by hunting and killing of wild beaſts.

The Countrey of the Eaſt and South parts well manured and fruitfull, yielding a very ſpacious and pleaſing proſpect, both out of <hi>Cutbury</hi> Caſtle and that of <hi>Boulſover.</hi> The Weſt part, which they call the <hi>Peak,</hi> is not ſo pleaſing to the eye, though poſſibly as profitable to the Purſe, being rich in Iron, Lead, and Coals, which it yields abundantly, and grazing multitudes of Sheep on the Mountain tops. It contains in it 106 Pariſhes, of the which eight be Market-Towns, the chief thereof being <hi>Derby,</hi> as before is ſaid; the Catalogue of whoſe Earls here followeth.</p>

This work great Prince, (which moſt humbly begs your Protection, as the ſafest Azylum) proceeds from a pen altogether Rural, yet doth it contain matter fit for imitation, ſelected from Authors of faithfull integrity. Behold a <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> memorable for an Act recorded by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ancient Hiſtorians, who to make trial of true Christians, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly advance them, first exiled from his Court, all who would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate themſelves and adore the Pagan Gods; and after trial made, the Complyers he abhor'd, and revoked the conſtant refuſers; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to places of greatest trust and honour; affirming that they would never be true to a mortal Emperour, that would be falſe to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Diety. <hi>Quomodo inquit fidem erga Imperatorem ſervare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terunt inviolatam, qui adverſus Deum optimum maximum perfidi eſſe manifeſto convincuntur:</hi> and therefore ſaith the ſame Author, <hi>Decrevit ſecum hos qui ſe fideles erga D.

About noon, (the day ſomewhat declining) <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaw in the Sky, a lightſome pillar in form of a croſs, wherein were theſe words engraven. <hi>In this ſign overcome:</hi> and the night following in his ſleep he beheld Chriſt, who ſaid thus unto him. <hi>Frame unto thy ſelf the form of a Croſs, after the example of the ſign which appeared unto thee, and bear the ſame againſt thy Enemies as a fit banner or token of victory.</hi> And that the effects were anſwerable to the divine promiſes, hear what <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, as ſpoken by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> himſelf. <hi>Hoc ſalutari figno vero fortitudinis judicio veſtram Tiranidis jugo liberavi civitatem &amp;</hi> S.

But firſt of all for that they had found by their late experience what dangerous effects proceed from civil jars, they reſolved with common conſent to run all joyntly one and the ſame courſe: and for the better ſtrengthening of this their purpoſe they elected a King whoſe name was <hi>Vortiger,</hi> a man much eſteemed both for the Nobility of his birth (as being extract from the line of the Brittiſh Princes) and alſo for the General good opinion conceived of his ſufficiency to undergo ſo weighty a charge, though the eminency of his degree did ſoon after lay open thoſe vices and infirmities which his private life had concealed. To him did all the petty Princes in the Iſle ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>They then entered into Conſultation together, and called to minde the Conditions of ſuch Nations as were moſt known unto them, conſidering well with themſelves, that from the Romans there was no more relief to be expected (<hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, the ſeat of the Empire, being invaded by ſtrangers) and <hi>France</hi> was aſſailed as well as <hi>Brittain.</hi> That <hi>Germanie</hi> (though a mighty and ample Region) was not altogether free from incumbrance.

For touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities of the minde, they were bold, hardy, and vain glorious, patiently enduring labour, hunger and cold, whereunto by the conſtitution of their bodies, and temperance of the Climate they ſeemed to be framed, as being very ſtrong, and yet not unwieldy, tall of ſtature, but not uncomely or out of due proportion. For the North Region by reaſon of the coldneſſe of the air, which driveth the natural heat inward, bringeth forth men commonly of greater courage and ability of body, then thoſe countreys that lye nearer the ſun. Their dyet was ſimple and homely, neither knew they any other a long time, till by attaching ſome of the Roman ſhips, ſtragling about the coaſts of <hi>France</hi> and the Lower <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> they became firſt acquainted with their manner of Victualling. Their habit was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coſtly nor cumberſome, but ſerving indeed rather for decency and ornament then for defence againſt the ſharpneſſe of the air, or ſuch like annoyances. For their garments were commonly of linnen or yarne, woven with divers colours, and hanging looſe about them, the locks of their hair (which in former time they had been accuſtomed to ſhave) being then curled and ſpread abroad in compaſſe, ſo that they covered their ſhoulders and upper parts of their caſſocks. The weapons which they ordinarily uſed in fights, were
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61256:110"/> long ſpears, round targets, and betle axes, having alſo (truſſed up at their backs) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhort ſwords, which they did wear continually for readineſſe upon all occaſions. In the art of Navigation they were very expert, and lived at the firſt by pilfery, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by open robbery, being trained up therein, even from their childhood, under a kind of diſcipline: ſtormes at ſea, unſeaſonable weather, perils of Rocks and Sands loſs of goods and ſhipwracks (which terrifie other men) they careleſſely contemned, while they ſeemed to have not only a certain knowledge of them,<note place="margin">The cuſtomes and manners of the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                        </note> but alſo a certain familiarity with them. The Offices of Souldiers and Marriners they executed with like skill, and often times with equall advantage. There was no kind of Cruelty, in a manner new or ſtrange unto them. Neither were they altogether void of policie, in watching opportunity of time and place, to further their deſigns, albeit they were for the moſt part more ſuddain in attempting and procuring other mens harmes, then wary or well adviſed in avoiding their own. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in degrees they hardly admitted, but each man commanded and obeyed as the cauſe required, being as ready to learn of his fellowes what he knew not, as to inſtruct others in thoſe things wherein he happened to be skillfuller then the reſt. Of their blood they were nothing at all ſparing, but they exerciſed cruelty, ſometimes even upon themſelves, as making no account to caſt away their own lives, rather then to endure any publick ſhame, ſcorn or diſgrace.</p>

The Noble men were nothing pleaſed herewith, and miſliking altogether the lack of diſcretion in their new King, they doubted much leaſt in time to come he would have more delight to advance men of baſe lineage and degree, then ſuch as were deſcended of noble parentage: yet becauſe they would not put the ſtate of the Land in danger, through any mutiny they agreed to go forth with him in that journey. <hi>Occa</hi> had advertiſement given him by ſecreet letters ſent to him by ſome cloſe friends among the Brittains of the whole matter, and therefore in hope of the better ſucceſſe, he made all poſſible ſpeed to encounter the Brittains: and thus the one army coming in fight of the other, they prepare to the battail, and ſhortly after the firſt onſet the <hi>Brittains</hi> retreated and turned their backs, by reaſon that one of their chiefeſt Commanders called <hi>Gothlois</hi> diſdaining to be under <hi>Nathaliod,</hi> got him up to the top of the next hill; with ſuch as were under his power and charge, leaving the other Brittains in eminent danger, which they perceiving began alſo to ſave themſelves by flight.

Of this <hi>Porth</hi> the town and haven of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> took the name, as ſome have thought. Moreover about ſixty years after the comming of the Saxons into this land with their leader <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> one <hi>Nazaleod</hi> a mighty King among the Brittains, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled all the power he could make to fight with <hi>Certicus</hi> the King of the Weſt Saxons, who, underſtanding the great power of his enemies, required aid of <hi>Oska</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> alſo of <hi>Elle</hi> King of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and of <hi>Porth</hi> and his Sons which were lately arrived: <hi>Certicus</hi> being then furniſhed with a competent army, divided the ſame into two battails reſerving the one to himſelf and the other he appointed to his ſon <hi>Kenrick.</hi>

                        <p>Hereupon he gave ſuch a fierce charge, that by pure force he opened the ſame, and ſo overthrew the Saxons on that ſide making great ſlaughter of them as they were ſcattered.<note place="margin">

And if they had airy bodies (as they have not, yet) they could not have ſuch generation, for the power or force to engender belongeth to the vegitative ſoul, whoſe proper operations are to turne nutriment into ſubſtance of the ſubject wherein it is, and to engender new iſſue or offspring from the ſame, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſheweth l. 2. <hi>de anima, textu</hi> 24. And in what body ſoever there is a vegitative ſoul, it muſt needs be that the ſame was engendered, and muſt ſometime decay and die, and ſo the devills ſhould be mortall. Moreover if they could have generation together with mankind, then ſuch iſſue ſhould be a diſtinct ſpecies both from man and Divell, as a mule differeth both from Horſe and Aſſe, and again if ſpirits had abuſed women in aſſumpted bodies and ſhapes of men, yet they did not take them to wives, as the Scripture ſaith they did who begat theſe giants. Finally the holy Scripture expreſly calleth the giants, men, <hi>Theſe be the mighty ones, famous men.</hi> The modeſty of Scripture terming them famous, whom our common phraſe would call infamous, being more monſtrous in wickedneſs of mind, then in hugeneſſe of body.

                        <p>At his returne into <hi>Brittain,</hi> he found that <hi>Mordred</hi> had cauſed himſelf to be made King, and having allyed himſelf with <hi>Childrick</hi> a Saxon, (not him whom <hi>Gaufride</hi> as ye have heard ſuppoſeth to have been ſlain before) was ready to have reſiſted his landing, ſo that before he could come to ſhore he loſt many of his men; but yet at length he repulſed his enemies, but not without great loſſe of his own men; and at length landed at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and then joyned in battail with his enemies: in this conflict was ſlain <hi>Gawin</hi> a noble Chieftain, whoſe death he much lamented, who was brother to <hi>Mordred,</hi> who like a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gentleman regarding more his honour and loyal truth then neerneſſe of blood, choſe rather to fight in the quarrel of his lawful King and loving maſter, then to take part with his natural brother in an unjuſt cauſe, and ſo there in that battail was ſlain, together alſo with <hi>Auguiſal,</hi> to whom <hi>Arthur</hi> formerly had committed the government of <hi>Scotland.

                        <p>But now to ſpeak ſome things of the Queen, King <hi>Arthur</hi> his conſort, ſome are of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61256:117"/> opinion that ſhe took that name from her excellent beauty, becauſe <hi>Cuynne,</hi> (if truly written) in the Welſh tongue ſignifieth fair, ſo that ſhe was named <hi>Guenuere,</hi> or <hi>Guenllean,</hi> even as you would ſay the fair and butifull <hi>Heonere</hi> or <hi>Helen;</hi> ſhe was brought up in the houſe of <hi>Cador</hi> D. or E. of <hi>Cornwall</hi> before <hi>Arthur</hi> married her, and as it appeareth by writers, ſhe was evill reported of, as noted of Incontinency and breech of faith to her husband; but excellent beauties ſeldom eſcape the venemous blaſts of detracting and envious tongues, and never want the amorous courtings of laſcivious wantons. The Brittiſh hiſtory affirmeth that ſhe did not only abuſe her ſelf by unlawfull company with <hi>Mordred,</hi> but that alſo in <hi>Arthurs</hi> abſence, ſhe conſented to take him to husband.</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe found recorded by an old writer, that <hi>Arthur</hi> beſieged the Marches near <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> for diſpleaſure that he bore unto a certain Lord called <hi>Melva,</hi> who had ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <hi>Guuennere,</hi> and led her into thoſe Marches and there did keep her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arthur</hi> had two wives as <hi>Girald. Cam.</hi> affirmeth, of which, the later ſaith he was buried with him, and her bones found in his own Sepulchre ſo devided, yet that two parts of the Tombe towards the head were appointed to receive the bones of the man, and the third part towards the feet contained the womans bones a part by themſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> writeth, that Queen <hi>Guennere</hi> being taken by the <hi>Picts,</hi> was conveyed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> were finally ſhe died, and was there buried in <hi>Angus.</hi> And this may be true, if <hi>Arthur</hi> had three ſeveral wives, each of them bearing the name of <hi>Guenhere,</hi> as Sir <hi>John Price</hi> avoucheth.</p>
                        <p>But by reaſon of the diſagreeing of writers touching the great acts atchieved by this <hi>Arthur,</hi> and alſo for that ſome difference there is amongſt them, about the time in which he ſhould reign, many have doubted of the truth of the whole hiſtory, which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him.</p>

                        <p>The writer of the book called <hi>Aurea Hiſtoria</hi> affirmeth, that in the tenth year of <hi>Cerdicus</hi> King of Weſt <hi>Saxons,</hi>

                        <p>Whether the number of theſe Knights, was many, or few, I do not find, but it ſeemeth imparted to a great many, all perſons of high dignitie and much proweſs; for unto King <hi>Arthur</hi> at <hi>Caerleon</hi> in <hi>Monmoth-Shire</hi> reſorted at one time ten Kings,<note place="margin">

                           </note> and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Earls, beſides many Barons and other Knights of meaner qualitie.</p>
                        <p>As the conqueſts of the King were many, ſo was his bounty notable; for it is written that unto his chief Scheneſhal or Steward called <hi>Kay,</hi> he gave the province of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,</hi> on his Butler <hi>Bedwere</hi> he beſtowed <hi>Normandy,</hi> and to his Cozen <hi>Berel,</hi> he granted the Dutchy of <hi>Buriundy,</hi> and unto many other Lords and valiant Knights he allotted other magnificent gifts according to their vertue.</p>

Sir <hi>John Hayward</hi> writing the life of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, who is commonly called <hi>William</hi> the baſtard, tells us it was a generall cuſtome at that time in <hi>France,</hi> that baſtards did ſucceed even in dignities of higheſt degree and condition, no otherwiſe then children lawfull begotten. <hi>Thierry</hi> baſtard of <hi>Clovis</hi> had for his partage with the dutifull Children of the ſaid <hi>Clovis,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Austraſie</hi> now called <hi>Lowain; Sigisbert</hi> baſtard to King <hi>Dagobert</hi> the firſt had his part in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Clovis</hi> the twelfth, lawfull Son to <hi>Dagobert; Loys</hi> and <hi>Carloman</hi> baſtards to King <hi>Loyis le Begue</hi> ſucceeded after the death of their Father; ſo likewiſe in <hi>England, Alfride</hi> baſtard Son to <hi>Oſwine,</hi> ſucceeded his Brother <hi>Egfride.</hi> So <hi>Adelſtane</hi> the baſtard Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, ſucceeded his Father before <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Eldred</hi> his younger Brothers, notwithſtanding they were lawfully begotten. So St. <hi>Edmund</hi> the Martyr baſtard Son to King <hi>Edgar,</hi> ſucceeded him in the ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ethelbred</hi> his lawfull iſſue. Afterward <hi>Harold,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Harefoot,</hi> baſtard to <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> ſucceeded him in the Kingdom before <hi>Hardi Canutus</hi> his lawfull ſon. The like cuſtome hath been obſerved in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> and in divers other Countries. And it is probable that this uſe was grounded upon often experience that baſtards (begotten in the higheſt heat and ſtrength of affection) have many times been men of excellent proof, both in courage and underſtanding; this was verified in <hi>Hercules, Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Romulus, Timotheus, Brutus, Themiſtocles, Arthur;</hi> in <hi>Homer, Demoſthenes, Bion, Bartholus, Gracian, Peter Lumbard, Peter Comestor, John Andreas,</hi> and divers of moſt floriſhing name; but this cuſtome now concerning ſucceſsion of baſtards in Kingdomes, Royalties, and other inheritances, is obſolete and quite aboliſhed.</p>

                        <p>It ſeemeth that this <hi>Malgo</hi> is named by <hi>Gildas Maglocunus,</hi> which <hi>Gildas,</hi> before he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of him, inveigheth againſt one <hi>Cuneglaſus,</hi> whom he reproveth, for that he warred both againſt God and Man; againſt God with grievous ſins, as namely. Adultery in forſaking the Company of his lawfull Wife, and keeping to Concubine a Siſter of hers, that had profeſſed chaſtity: and againſt man with material Armour and Weapons, which he uſed to the Deſtruction of his own countreymen, with whom he kept Wars, and not againſt the Enemies of the Common-Wealth.</p>
                        <p>From <hi>Cuneglaſus</hi> he cometh to the foreſaid <hi>Maglocune,</hi> whom he nameth <hi>The Dragon of the Iſles, and the Expeller of many Tyrants,</hi> not onely out of their Kindomes, but alſo out of Life, the laſt of whom he intreateth as himſelf ſaith, but the firſt in all Miſchief, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, greater then many in Power, and likewiſe in Malice; right liberal in giving, and more plentifull in ſin, ſtrong and valiant in Arms, but ſtronger in Deſtruction of his own Soul; and ſo proceeding, chargeth him with the ſin of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and ſore blameth him for that whereas it had pleaſed God to make him higher then all other Chieftains of his Kindome, he did not ſhew himſelf better, but contrarily worſe then they by far, in manners and conditions. He declareth alſo a little after, that this <hi>Maglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cune</hi> in his younger years, ſlew in Battel his Uncle being King, with the moſt valiant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in a manner that he had.</p>
                        <p>Alſo, that whereas the ſaid <hi>Maglocune</hi> took upon him the profeſſion of a Monk, he after renounced the ſame, and became a worſe Liver then ever he was before, abandoning his Wife, and keeping his Brothers Sons Wife, whilſt her Husband was yet living.</p>
                        <p>Thus, by that which <hi>Gildas</hi> writeth of the Kings and Rulers of <hi>Brittain,</hi> which lived in his daies, ye may perceive that they were given to all manner of Wickedneſs, and namely to civil Diſſention, Rapine, Adultery, and Fornication; ſo that it may be thought, that God ſtirred up the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be a ſcourge to them, and to worke his juſt Vengeance upon them for their wicked and abominable Offences daily committed againſt his Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; ſo that we finde recorded by Writers, how that the <hi>Saxons</hi> in divers conflicts againſt the <hi>Brittains,</hi> had the better, and alſo took from them divers Towns, as hath been partly already, and ſhall hereafter be made manifeſt.</p>

                        <p>Therefore after the three Sons of <hi>Brutus</hi> had divided the whole Iſle of <hi>Brittain</hi> into three parts, that part contained within the <hi>French</hi> Seas, with the Rivers of <hi>Severn</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Brittiſh Hafern) Dee</hi> and <hi>Humber</hi> fell to the eldeſt Son <hi>Locrinus,</hi> which was after his name called <hi>Lhoyger,</hi> which name it hath in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Tongue to this day, but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> called <hi>England,</hi> and is augmented <hi>Northward</hi> to the River <hi>Tweed.</hi> The ſecond Son, (or as ſome ſay the third) <hi>Albanactus,</hi> had all the Land <hi>Northward</hi> from <hi>Humber</hi> to the Sea <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> called in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Tongue <hi>Norweryth,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Mare Calidonium.</hi> The third Son <hi>Camber,</hi> (or rather the ſecond) had for his part that remained undivided, lying within the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas, and ſeparated from <hi>England</hi> by the Rivers <hi>Severn</hi> &amp; <hi>Dee,</hi> part was after his name called <hi>Cambria,</hi> and the Inhabitants thereof <hi>Cambri,</hi> and their Language <hi>Camberaec,</hi> and ſo are at this day, ſo that they have kept the ſame Countrey and Language this 2690. years and above (ſaith this Authour, when that Chronicle was printed which bears no date) without commixtion with any other Nation, eſpecially in <hi>North Wales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And becauſe the name of the Country is changed, or rather miſtaken by the inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> and not by them called <hi>Cambry</hi> but <hi>Wales,</hi> I think it neceſſary to declare the occaſion thereof, which is, That whereas the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a people of <hi>Germany,</hi> were the firſt that after the <hi>Brittains</hi> inhabited and ruled the greateſt part of this Iſland, and drove the <hi>Brittains</hi> into that corner, a which according to the manner of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey they called <hi>VVales,</hi>

And here I cannot paſſe over what one of the five Chroniclers writ of late, of the name of <hi>Brittain,</hi> affirming that it ſhould be ſo called of <hi>Brittain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as the elder of that name; but ſure he had either never ſeen <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> nor <hi>Cæſar,</hi> nor any other ancient writer, or read them with ſmall judgment and memory; for there he might have learned that when this land was called <hi>Brittain,</hi> the other was called <hi>Armorica,</hi> and how in <hi>Maximus</hi> time <hi>Conan Meriadoc</hi> was the firſt that gave it that name, and inhabited it with <hi>Brittains</hi> out of this Iſle; other derivations of theſe words, out of Greek and Latine, I am aſhamed to relate, (of which I have ſpoken formerly) I will therefore returne to the deſcription of <hi>Wales,</hi> which was almoſt in old time compaſſed about with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeas, and the Rivers <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Severne,</hi> although afterwards the <hi>Saxons</hi> wan by force from the <hi>Brittains,</hi> all the plain (as is already ſaid) and champion Countries over the rivers; and ſpecially <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> who made a ditch of great breadth and depth to be a Meare betwixt his Kingdom and <hi>Wales;</hi> which ditch began at the river <hi>Dee</hi> by <hi>Baſingwerk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> and ran along the hills ſides to the South ſea a little from <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,</hi> reaching above an hundred miles in length, and is in many places to be ſeen at this day; bearing the name of <hi>Clawdh Offa, viz.

Other (as <hi>Sylveſter Giraldus</hi>) make the river <hi>Wy</hi> called in Welſh <hi>Guy</hi> to be a mear between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> on the South part called <hi>South-VVales,</hi> who meaſureth the breadth of <hi>VVales</hi> from <hi>Sallowe</hi> or <hi>VVillowford</hi> called <hi>Rhydyrhelig</hi> upon <hi>VVy,</hi> to St. <hi>Davids</hi> in <hi>Menevia</hi> a 100 miles; and the length from <hi>Caertheon</hi> upon <hi>

                        <p>Theſe three were <hi>Gwyneth, Northwales Dehenbarth Southwales,</hi> and <hi>Powis</hi> land, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which he ordained a princely ſeat or Court for a Prince to remain at moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly: as in <hi>Gwyneth</hi> (which ſome old writers call <hi>Venedocia,</hi>

                        <p>And here I think it good to let the Reader underſtand what the Brittiſh. Chronicle ſaith of Northwales, which affirmeth that three times by inheritance it came to Women; firſt to <hi>Stradwen,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cadvan ap Conan ap Endaf,</hi> and wife to <hi>Coel Godeboc,</hi> Mother to <hi>Genaw, Dyvor</hi> and <hi>Gwawl.</hi> The ſecond time to the ſame <hi>Gwawl</hi> wife to <hi>Edeyrn ap Padern,</hi> and mother to <hi>Cunetha Wledic;</hi> which <hi>Cunetha</hi> inhabiting in the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> about the year 540. after the incarnation of Chriſt, and hearing how the mingled Nations of the <hi>Iriſh, Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> had overrun the ſea ſhore of <hi>Cardigan,</hi> which was part of his inheritance, ſent his ſons thither to enjoy their inheritance; of the which <hi>Tibiaon</hi> his eldeſt ſon died in <hi>Man,</hi> which land the ſaid <hi>Iriſh Scots</hi> had wan; for <hi>Gildas</hi> ſaith that of the Children of <hi>Clam Hector,</hi> which peopled a great part of <hi>Ireland, Yſcroeth</hi> with his people inhabited <hi>Dalrienda,</hi> which is a part of <hi>Scotland. Builke</hi> with his people came to <hi>Man;</hi> but I think it good to put in <hi>Gildas</hi> words, which ſaith, <hi>Builke cum filiis ſuis inhabitavit Euboni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Inſulam vulgo Manaw quæ eſt in meditullio maris inter Hiberniam &amp; Brittanniam;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Builke</hi> with his Children inhabited the Iſle <hi>Eubonia,</hi> commonly called <hi>Manaw</hi> (for ſo it is and was named in Brittiſh) which lyeth in the middle of the ſea, between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Brittain.</hi> This was not called <hi>Mona,</hi> as <hi>Polidore</hi> ſaith: The children of <hi>Bethoun</hi> inhabited <hi>Demetia,</hi> which is <hi>Southwales,</hi> with <hi>Gwyr</hi> and <hi>Cydweli</hi> till they were chaſed thence by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Cunetha;</hi> thus far <hi>Gildas.</hi> Therefore the Sons of <hi>Cunetha</hi> being arived in <hi>Northwales</hi> (as well I think being driven by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as for their inheritance) divided the Country betwixt them.

But to my former matter, theſe names given by the ſons of <hi>Cunetha</hi> remain to this day. After this the <hi>Iriſh-Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> which the Brittains called <hi>Y Gwidhyl Phichiaid,</hi> which is to ſay, the <hi>Iriſh Picts,</hi> did overrun the Iſle of <hi>Môn,</hi> and were driven thence by <hi>Caſwalhon Lhawhir,</hi> that is <hi>Caſwalhon</hi> with the long hand, the Son of <hi>Eneon Yrch ap Cunedha,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Seoigi</hi> their King with his own hands at <hi>Lhany Gwydhyl</hi> which is the Iriſh church at <hi>Holyhead.</hi> This <hi>Caſwalhon</hi> was father to <hi>Maelgon Gwyneth</hi> whom the Latines call <hi>Maglocunus</hi> Prince and King of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>

                           <p>As ſoon as the King underſtood this, he called <hi>Cadogan</hi> before him, and gave him his brothers Land, which was <hi>Powis,</hi> and promiſed <hi>Owen</hi> his pardon, willing his Father to ſend him to <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                           <hi>Lhandaff</hi> is one of the moſt ancient Biſhops Sees, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> and clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth direct ſucceſſion from the Archbiſhops of <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sk,</hi> as unto the Biſhoprick, though for the Metropolitan dignity it be content to let St. <hi>Davids</hi> have what is left there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The firſt Biſhop here, of whom is any good record, is St. <hi>Dubritius,</hi> conſecrate by Saint <hi>Lupus</hi> and <hi>Germanus;</hi> that time they came hither out of <hi>France,</hi> for the extirpation of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſie. The Church he dedicated to St. <hi>Thelianus,</hi> the next ſucceſſor to St. <hi>Dubritius,</hi> founded on the River <hi>Taff,</hi> and thence called <hi>Landaff,</hi> then in the Welſh tongue ſignifying a Church or Holy Place, a Church very well endowed by the munificence and piety of great perſons in thoſe times, ſo well that it is affirmed by Mr. <hi>Godwin,</hi> that were it poſſeſſed now of the tenth part onely of what once it had, it might be reckoned one of the richeſt Churches in all Chriſtendom. The ruine of it came in the time of Biſh. <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> alias <hi>Kitehin,</hi> who thereupon is called <hi>Fundi noſtri calamitas,</hi> by <hi>Biſh. Godwin.</hi> The Dioceſs containeth onely part of <hi>Glamorganſhire,</hi> and part of <hi>Monmothſhire,</hi> though the moſt of each; and in thoſe parts 177 Pariſhes, whereof 98 Impropriations, and for them one Archdeacon, which is called of <hi>Lhandaff;</hi> the Biſhoprick was valued in the Kings book 154 l. 14 s. 1 d. the Clergy paying for their Tenth ſomewhat near the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> 155 l. 5 s. 4 d. It is to be obſerved, or may be obſerved if it pleaſe the Reader, that neither here nor at St. <hi>Davids</hi> there is any Dean,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Godwin</hi> in <hi>Landaff</hi> fol. 423.</note> nor ever was in any of the times before us; the Biſhop being the head of the ſeveral Chapters, and in his abſence the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con here, as is the Chaunter at St. <hi>Davids.</hi>

                        <p>The Cathedral Church of <hi>Landaff</hi> is reported to have been firſt built in the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> about the year of our Lord Chriſt 180. But I perceive not that any Biſhop ſate there before <hi>Dubritius,</hi> who by <hi>Germanus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Altiſiodore,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The antiquity of the Church of <hi>Landaff.</hi>
                           </note> and <hi>Lupus</hi> of <hi>Trecaſia</hi> (two Biſhops of <hi>France</hi>) was removed to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Caerleon.</hi> Of the occaſion of their double journey into theſe parts (for they were twice here) and of <hi>Dubritius</hi> we have ſpoken already. So we muſt account St. <hi>Dubritius</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Lhandaff;</hi> not that I deny any other to have ſate there before him, but becauſe he is the firſt whoſe name is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; and it is probable he had no predeceſſors, becauſe the memory of all his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors is ſo carefully preſerved.</p>
                        <p>St. <hi>Tebian,</hi> alias <hi>Eliud,</hi> the ſecond Biſhop, was very nobly born and brought up under <hi>Dubritius</hi> his predeceſſor, and <hi>Saulinus</hi> together with St. <hi>David.</hi> I find delivered than ſoon after his coming to the Biſhoprick, he was conſtrained by a ſtrange diſeaſe reigning in thoſe parts to fly into <hi>France;</hi> whence after a ſeaſon he returned again, bringing home with him in three Ships his Countrey-men that had fled with him upon the ſame occaſion; he was afterwards ſlain in the Church of <hi>Lân-Delia-Hechan,</hi> by a certain noble man called <hi>Guraeddan;</hi> his Cathedral Church, where it ſeemeth he was buried, hath ever ſince born his name unto it; in the time of this man and his ſucceſſors, many Kings of <hi>England</hi> and Princes of <hi>Wales</hi> have given much land, and granted many notable priviledges; amongſt which, theſe are accounted the chiefeſt benefactors.</p>

The Prince being well pleaſed with this revenge, built up his Caſtle again and fortified it ſtrongly.<note place="margin">Caſtelh Catrec Hova.</note> The year following <hi>Owen</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gruffith ap Meredyth,</hi> named <hi>Owen Cyvelioc,</hi> and <hi>Owen ap Madoc ap Meredyth,</hi> got the Caſtle of <hi>Carrechona</hi> by <hi>Oſweſtrie</hi> and waſted it.</p>

King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond gathered a ſtrong army againſt <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales,</hi> and came himſelf as farr as <hi>Pencadyr</hi> beſide <hi>Brecknock,</hi> where <hi>Rees</hi> came to him and did homage, and gave him pledges, which done, the King went out of <hi>Wales.</hi> About this time <hi>Eneon</hi> the Son of <hi>Anarawd ap Gruffith,</hi> Nephew to Prince <hi>Rees,</hi> was murdered in his bed by a Man of his own, named <hi>Lhywarch.</hi> Alſo <hi>Cadogan ap Meredyth</hi> was ſlain in the like manner by one <hi>Walter ap Ricard.</hi> The Lord <hi>Rees,</hi> as he is called in Welſh, or King <hi>Rees,</hi> as Latin Authors call him, took the <hi>Cantreff Maur</hi> (which is a great Country) and the Land of <hi>Dynevowr</hi> and enjoyed it. And this year died <hi>Cadivor ap Daniel</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Caerdigan,</hi> and <hi>Henry ap Arthen</hi> who was the worthieſt Clerk that had been in <hi>Wales</hi> many years. The year enſuing, the Lord <hi>Rees</hi> ſeeing he was not able to maintain his Eſtate with ſuch Lands as the King had appointed him, entered into the Territory of <hi>Roger de Clare,</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> (for by that Earls means his Nephew was murdered) and wan the Caſtles of <hi>Aberheidol,</hi> and of the ſons of <hi>Wywyaon,</hi> and raiſed them. And thus in ſhort time he brought all <hi>Caerdigan</hi> under his ſubjection; from thence he made many inroads againſt the Flemmings, and brought away great ſpoiles. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fortune cauſed all <hi>VVales</hi> to conſpire the ſhaking off of the <hi>Norman</hi> yoak (whoſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and cruelty they could not abide) and to elect Princes of their own Nation.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1165. <hi>David</hi> the ſon of <hi>Owen</hi> Prince of <hi>Northwales</hi> did deſtroy all <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> which was the Kings,<note place="margin">K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s third voyage in vain againſt the <hi>Welſh.</hi>

About the ſame time died <hi>Lhewelin,</hi> ſon to <hi>Pr Owen,</hi> a worthy Gentleman, and of great towardneſs. In the year enſuing, the <hi>Flemmings</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> came to Weſt <hi>Wales;</hi> with a great power againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Cilgerran</hi> (which <hi>Rees</hi> had fortified) and laid ſiege unto it, aſſaulting it divers times; but it was ſo manfully defended, that they returned home as they came; and ſhortly after they came before it again, where they loſt many of their beſt men, and ſo departed. The ſame year <hi>Owen Pr.</hi> of North <hi>Wales,</hi> laid ſiege to the Caſtle of <hi>Baſygwerke,</hi> which the King had fortified, and in ſhort time wan it, and diſmantled it.

After that they gat the Caſtle of <hi>Proſtatyn,</hi> and deſtroyed it; and then brought all <hi>Tegeugl</hi> to <hi>Owens</hi> ſubjection, and returned home with much honour.

Afterward they brought the <hi>Cantref Maur</hi> under ſubjection, which cauſed <hi>Rees <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>achan</hi> to remove his wife and children to his brothers country, and left the caſtle of <hi>Lhanymdhfry</hi> well fortified and manned.

And as he encamped at <hi>Lhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruc, Reynalt Bruſe</hi> came to him with ſix Knights in his company, and deſired of his father in Law pardon for his defence, who receiving him lovingly did not only forgive him, but gave him alſo the caſtle of <hi>Sengbennyth,</hi> and <hi>Reynalt</hi> committed the ſame to the cuſtody of <hi>Rees Vachar.

                        <p>Thirdly that for performance of theſe they ſhould deliver forthwith to the Prince twenty pledges of the beſt in all the country, which things they did; Then the Prince returned into <hi>Northwales</hi> with much honour.<note place="margin">Caerleon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the E. of Pembrock.</note> Shortly after <hi>William Marſhal</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi> got the town of <hi>Caerlheon,</hi> and made war againſt the <hi>Welſhmen,</hi> whom contrary to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the Barons left out of the concluſion of peace.

                        <p>When <hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of Bangor ſaw that <hi>David</hi> dealt ſo hardly with his brother <hi>Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith,</hi> contrary to his faithful promiſe made unto the ſaid Biſhop, he excommunicated him; and then withdrawing himſelf out of <hi>Wales,</hi> made a grievous complaint to the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>David,</hi> moſt inſtantly requeſting the King to deliver <hi>Gruffith</hi> out of priſon, leaſt the rumour of that fact being notified in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and other Countries out of the realm, ſhould be ſome ſtain of the Kings honour, if he ſhould not withſtand ſuch outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and unlawful dealings. The King therefore greatly blaming <hi>David</hi> his nephew for abuſing his brother in ſuch ſort as he did, requeſted him with moſt pithy perſwaſions to ſet his brother at liberty, as well for the preſerving of his own credit and fame, as alſo for the avoyding of the excommunication, and other eminent dangers which might enſue of that matter. To the which requeſt of the King, <hi>David</hi> anſwered plainly, that he would not deliver his brother out of priſon; affirming conſtantly, that if his brother were enlarged, the Countrey of <hi>Wales</hi> would be in great diſquietneſs. Whereof when <hi>Gruffith</hi> was certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he ſendeth privately to the King, promiſing that if he would forcibly deliver him out of his brothers priſon, he would hold his lands of him, and pay him 200 marks year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; offering not only to be ſworn upon this, and deliver Pledges for performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but alſo to aid the King to bring the reſt of the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> under his ſubjection. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gruffith</hi> Lord of <hi>Bromfield</hi> did aſſure the King of aid, if he would come to <hi>Wales</hi> with an Army, to chaſtize <hi>David</hi> for his falſhood and injury uſed towards his brother. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Biſhop of <hi>Banger</hi> procured the land of <hi>David</hi> to be interdicted. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by theſe promiſes on <hi>Gruffiths</hi> behalf, levied a puiſant Army to go into <hi>Wales;</hi> ſtraightly commanding by his Writs all ſuch as ought him ſervice in time of War, to give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon him, ready with Sword and Armour at <hi>Gloceſter</hi> the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to ſet forward againſt his enemies, whether the King came at the day appointed; and from thence went to <hi>Salop,</hi> and remained there 15 dayes.</p>
                        <p>During the Kings abode at <hi>Salop,</hi> divers noble men were great ſuters unto him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Gruffith,</hi> as <hi>Ralph</hi> Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> of <hi>Wigmore, Walter Clifford, Roger de Monte alto</hi> Steward of <hi>Cheſter, Maelgon</hi> the ſon of <hi>Maelgon, Meredyth ap Rotpert</hi> Lord of <hi>Cyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, Gruffith ap Madoc</hi> Lord of <hi>Bromfield, Howell</hi> and <hi>Meredyth</hi> the ſons of <hi>Conan ap Owen Gwyneth,</hi> and <hi>Gruffith</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> Lord of <hi>Powis;</hi> theſe wrought ſo with the King, that there was a league concluded between him and <hi>Senena</hi> the wife of the ſaid <hi>Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith</hi> in the behalf of her husband, lying then in his brothers priſon, according to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles comprized in this Charter following:</p>

                           <p>In witneſſe whereof to this preſent writing I have put to my Seal; Dated at <hi>Alnet</hi> by the River of <hi>Elwey</hi> in the feaſt of the dedication of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> in the 25 year of the reign of the ſaid King.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> fol. 306.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the Obſervation of theſe Articles, the ſaid Prince <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Ednivet Vachan</hi> were ſworn.</p>
                           <p>Upon theſe atonements <hi>David</hi> ſent privately unto the King,<note place="margin">Juſtice done, not for Juſtice ſake, but for ſelf ends.</note> to deſire him that he would ſuffer him, being his Nephew and the lawful heir of <hi>Lhewelin</hi> his father, to enjoy the principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> rather then <hi>Gruffith</hi> who was but a Baſtard (though ſome account him legitimate) and nothing of kin unto the King; giving him withal to underſtand, that in caſe he did ſet <hi>Gruffith</hi> at liberty, he ſhould be ſure to have the war renewed: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King knowing thoſe things to be true, and underſtanding alſo that <hi>Gruffith</hi> was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſtout man, and had many friends and favourers of his cauſe, inclined rather to aſſent unto <hi>Davids</hi> requeſt, then otherwiſe to be in danger of further troubles, and therefore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly granted the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Shortly after <hi>David</hi> ſent his brother <hi>Gruffith</hi> unto the King, and other pledges for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the performance of the ſaid Articles,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Paris</hi> p. 765 From priſon to priſon, like a fiſh out of the frying pan into the fire.</note> which the King ſent forthwith to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> there to be ſafely kept, allowing to <hi>Gruffith</hi> a Noble dayly for his maintenance. And within few dayes after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> P. <hi>David</hi> came to the K. Court, and did him homage, and ſwore fealty, who for ſo doing, and becauſe he was the Kings Nephew, was ſent home again in peace. When <hi>Gruffith</hi> ſaw how all things went, and that he was not like to be ſet at liberty, he began to deviſe means how to eſcape out of priſon.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore deceiving the Watch one night, he made a long line of hangings,<note place="margin">An unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate end of a deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> coverings and ſheets, and having got out of a window, let down himſelf by the ſame from the top of the Tower; but by reaſon that he was a mighty perſonage and full of fleſh, the line brake with the weight of his body, and ſo falling down headlong from a great height, his neck and head was driven into his body with the fall, whoſe miſerable Carkaſs being found the morrow after, was a pittiful ſpectacle to the beholders. The King being certified here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, commanded his ſon to be better looked unto, and puniſhed the Officers for their negligence.</p>
                           <p>About this time the <hi>King</hi> fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Dyſerth</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> and gave to <hi>Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith</hi> ſon to <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> Lord of <hi>Powis,</hi> his inheritance, and to the ſons of <hi>Conan ap Owen Gwy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi> their Lands in <hi>Merionith.</hi>

                           <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Bangor</hi> (a conſtant friend to that party) came to the Court to ſue for the deliverance of <hi>Gruffith</hi> ſon to <hi>Lhewelin</hi> the Prince; but the King knowing him to be a man of great courage, would in no wiſe grant his liberty.</p>

                        <p>It appeareth by the records in the Tower, that about this time, to wit <hi>An.</hi> 43. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. there was a commiſſion to <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter, John Manſel</hi> Treaſurer of <hi>York,</hi> the Kings Chaplain, and <hi>Peter de Montfort,</hi> to conclude a peace with the Welſhmen; but it is like there was nothing done to any effect in that behalfe; for the war continued ſtill.

It is further contained in the ſame peace, that neither the ſaid King nor his Succeſſors ſhould receive any of our Enemies, or any running from us or our Succeſſors, nor ſhould help or maintain any ſuch againſt us or our Succeſſors. The which all are contained in the form of peace, the Tenor whereof the Reverend Fathers of<hi> Strata Florida </hi>and<hi> Aberconwey </hi>bearers hereof, can ſhew you.</p>
                                 <p>But ſee Reverend Fathers, the Lord<hi> Edward </hi>now King of<hi> England, </hi>after the ſaid peace ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth into his hands certain Barons Lands in Wales, of which they and their Anceſtors have been long poſſeſſed, and keepeth a Barony in his hands, which ſhould be ours by the form of peace; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Barons of our Land being from us fugitives, runing to him, he keepeth, helpeth; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth,<hi> David ap Gruffith, </hi>and<hi> Gruffith ap Gwenwynwyn </hi>who purpoſed our death and deſtruction.

And though lawfull and reaſonable excuſes were alledged by our meſſengres before the King and his Councel, why the place was not ſafe nor indifferent, yet he refuſed to allow or appoint any other place indifferent for us, to do homage and fealty, which we were and are ready to do unto him in any ſafe place by him to be appointed, if he will appoint any, and to perform the other articles of the peace concluded and ſworn. And for that it pleaſeth him not to come to any place where we could with ſafety do him homage, we were ſuiters to him to ſend any from him to receive our oath and homage, untill it pleaſed him to appoint a place where we ſhall do our homage to him perſonally, the which thing he utterly denyed to do.</p>

And if he will not hearken to your Counſel therein, (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) that you will hold us excuſed; for we will no waies as much as lieth in us, procure the trouble and diſquietneſs of the Realm.

In that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt us to come to the Kings peace, we would have your Holineſs to know, That we are moſt ready and willing to the ſame, ſo that our Lord the King will duely and truely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep towards us and ours. Moreover, although we would be glad of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in <hi>Wales,</hi> yet we hope there ſhall not be any delay in us, but that peace (which of all things we moſt deſire and wiſh for) may be forthwith eſtabliſhed, and rather by your travel and procurement than by any other mens, ſo that it ſhall not be needful to complain unto the Pope of our wilfulneſs; neither do we deſpiſe your Fatherhoods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and painful travel, but with all hearty reverence, according to our duty do accept the the ſame: neither yet ſhall it be needful for the Lord the King, to uſe any force againſt us, ſeeing we are ready to obey him in all things, our Rights and Laws (as aforeſaid) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And although the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> be under the ſpecial protection of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with ſpecial love regarded by the ſame; yet when the Lord the Pope with the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall underſtand of the great dammages which are done unto us by the <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> to wit, The Articles of the peace concluded and ſworn unto, violated and broken, the robbing and burning of Churches, the murthering of Eccleſiaſtical perſons, as well religious as ſecular, the ſlaughter of women great with child, the children ſucking at their mothers breaſts, the deſtroying of Hoſpitals and Houſes of Religion, killing the men and women profeſſed in the Holy Places, and even before the Altars: We hope that your Fatherhood, and the ſaid Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> will rather with pity lament our caſe, than with rigor of puniſhment augment our ſorrow. Neither ſhall the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be in any wiſe diſquieted or troubled by our means (as is affirmed) ſo that we may have the peace duely kept and obſerved towards us and our people: Who they be that are delighted with blood-ſhed and war, is manifeſtly apparent by their deeds and behaviour; for we would live quietly upon our own, if we might be ſuffered, but the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to our Countrey, did put all to the ſword, neither ſparing ſex, age or ſickneſs, or any thing regarding Churches or ſacred Places; the like whereof the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> never committed.

That ſome began the war in a time not meet or convenient, that underſtood not we of till now; and yet they who did the ſame, do affirm, that in caſe they had not done as they did at that time, they had been ſlain or taken priſoners, being not in ſafety in their own houſes, and forced continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for ſafeguard of their lives, to keep themſelves in Armour; and therefore to deliver themſelves from that fear, they took that enterpriſe in hand.

                           </note> we will (as it becometh Chriſtians) repent and turn unto him; neither ſhall the war on our part be continued, ſo that we be ſaved harmleſs, and may live as we ought: but before we be diſinherited or ſlain, we muſt defend our ſelves as well as we may. Of all injuries and wrongs done by us, we are moſt willing and ready (upon the due examination and trial of the treſpaſſes and wrong committed on both ſides) to make ſatisfaction to the utmoſt of our power, ſo that the like on the Kings ſide be performed in like manner towards us, and our people: and to conclude and eſtabliſh a peace, we are moſt ready. But what peace can be eſtabliſhed, when as the Kings Charter ſo ſolemnly confirmed, is not kept and performed? Our people are daily oppreſſed with new exactions. We ſend unto you alſo a note in writing of the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61256:184"/> wrongs &amp; injuries which are done unto us, contrary to that Form of the peace before made, we have put our ſelves in Armour, being driven thereunto by neceſſity; for we and our people were ſo oppreſſed, trodden under foot, ſpoiled and brought to ſlavery by the Kings Officers, contrary to the Form of peace concluded againſt juſtice, none otherwiſe then if we were <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Jewes;</hi> whereof we have oftentimes complained unto the King, and never could get any Redreſs, but alwayes thoſe Officers were afterwards more fierce and cruel againſt us; and when thoſe Officers through their ravine and extortion were enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, other more hungry than they, were ſent afreſh to flea thoſe whom the other had ſhorn before; ſo that the people wiſhed rather to dye than to live in ſuch oppreſſion: And now it ſhall not be needful to leavy any Army to war upon us, or move the Prelates of the Church againſt us, ſo that the peace may be obſerved duely and truly, as before is expreſſed. Neither ought your holy fatherhood to give credit to all that our adverſaries do alleadge againſt us; for even as in their deeds they have and do oppreſs us, ſo in their words they will not ſtick to ſlaunder us, laying to our charge what liketh them beſt. Therefore foraſmuch as they are alwayes preſent with you, and we abſent from you, they oppreſſing, we oppreſſed, we are to deſire you, even for his ſake from whom nothing is hid, not to credit mens words, but to examine their deeds.</p>

If the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> will claim any right in any lands occupied by any other then by the Lord the King without the ſaid 4 Cantreſs, the ſaid Lord the King ſhall do him full ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of thoſe quarters or parts where the ſaid lands do lye. Which Article was not obſerved in the lands of <hi>Fruſtly,</hi> and betwixt the waters of <hi>Dyni</hi> and <hi>Dulas;</hi> for that when the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> claimed the ſaid lands before the Lord the King at <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> and the King granted him the cauſe to be examined according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Advocates of the parties were brought in, and the Judges, which vulgarly they called <hi>Ynnayd,</hi> before the King to judge of the ſaid lands, according to the Lawes of <hi>Wales;</hi> and the Defendant appeared and anſwered, ſo that the ſame day the cauſe ought to have been fully determined, according to the appointment of our Lord the King; who at his being at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had aſſigned the parties the ſaid day; and though the ſame cauſe was in divers places often heard and examined before the Juſtice, and the lands were in North <hi>Wales,</hi> and never judged but by the Laws of <hi>Wales,</hi> neither was it lawful for the King, but according to the Laws of <hi>Wales</hi> to prorogue the cauſe: All that notwithſtanding, he prorogued the day (of his own motion) contrary to the ſaid Laws; and at the laſt the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> was called to divers places, whither he ought not to have been called; neither could he obtain juſtice nor any judgement, unleſs it were according to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> contrary to the ſaid Article of peace; and the ſame was done at <hi>Montgomery,</hi> when the parties were preſent in judgement, and a day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hear the Sentence, they prorogued the ſaid day, contrary to the aforeſaid Laws, and at the laſt the King himſelf at <hi>London</hi> denied him juſtice, unleſs he would be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws in the ſaid matter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All Injuries, Treſpaſſes and Faults on either part done, be clearly remitted unto this preſent day. This Article was not kept, for that as ſoon as the Lord <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> was made Juſtice, he moved divers and innumerable accuſations againſt the men of <hi>Tegengl</hi> and <hi>Ros,</hi> for treſpaſſes done in the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> when they bare rule in thoſe parts; whereby the ſaid men dare not for fear keep their own houſes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whereas it was agreed, That <hi>Rees Vachan ap Rees ap Maelgon</hi> ſhall enjoy his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with all the land which he now holdeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the peace concluded, he was ſpoiled of his lands in <hi>Geneurglyn,</hi> which he then held, with the men and cattel of the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Alſo our Lord the King granteth, That all Tenants holding lands in the 4 Cantrefs or in other places, which the King holdeth in his own hands, ſhall hold and enjoy the ſame, as freely as they did before the time of the wars, and ſhall uſe the ſame liberties and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which they uſed before; contrary to this Article, the Lord <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> hath brought many new cuſtoms againſt the Form of peace aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. All Controverſies moved or to be moved betwixt the Prince and any other, ſhall be decided after the Law of the Marches (if they have their beginning in the Marches) and after the Laws of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſuch as in <hi>Wales</hi> have their beginning; contrary to this Article, the King doth, and ſendeth Juſtices to <hi>Angleſey,</hi> who preſume to judge there the men and ſubjects of the Prince, ſetting fines upon them contrary to the Lawes of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſeeing neither this, nor any like, was ever heard of in times paſt,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61256:184"/> impriſoning ſome, out-lawing others, when the Prince is at all times ready to do juſtice to all men that complain upon any of his men.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Where it is in the peace, That <hi>Gruffith Vachan</hi> ſhould do homage for the land in <hi>Yale,</hi> and to the Prince for the land in <hi>Ederneon,</hi> The Kings Juſtices brought the Lady of <hi>Maylor</hi> into the ſaid land of <hi>Ederneon;</hi> The knowledge of which cauſe onely pertained to the Prince, and not to the ſaid Juſtices; and yet for peace ſake, the ſaid Prince tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated all this; being at all times ready to miniſter juſtice to the ſaid Lady.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And though the ſaid Prince ſubmitted himſelf unto us and our will, yet we never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs will and grant, that our will in no caſe go further than is contained in thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Contrary to this Article Gold was exacted for the Queens works, at every pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made to the King; which Gold was never demanded in the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> or any other King of <hi>England;</hi> which Gold yet for quietneſs ſake the Prince paid, though it were not ſpoken of, or mentioned in the peace. And now further it is exacted, for the old Queen, the Kings mother that now is (for the peace concluded with King <hi>Henry</hi>) 2000 Marks and a half; and unleſs it be paid, the King threatneth to occupy the goods and lands of <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> and his people, which he could find in his Realm, and ſell men and beaſts till the ſum were paid.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. When the King invited the Prince at his Feaſt at <hi>Worcester,</hi> promiſing with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair words, that he would give his kinſwoman to him for wife, and enrich him with much honour; nevertheleſs, when he came thither the ſelf ſame day they ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, before Maſs the King required a Bill to be ſealed by the Prince, containing amongſt other things, That he would never keep man againſt the Kings will, nor never maintain any, whereby it might come to paſs, That all the Princes forces ſhould be called from him; the which Letter ſealed, he delivered the King by juſt fear, which might move any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant man: yet was not this contained in the peace, whereas the concluſion of peace was, That the King ſhould require nothing that was not contained in the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Where in the peace all Cuſtoms be confirmed to the ſaid Prince, as his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of long and daily obſerved Cuſtom have received to their own uſe all Wrecks hapning upon his own lands; The Juſtice of <hi>Cheſter</hi> took a diſtreſs of the Prince for goods of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, received by him before the wars, contrary to the Form of the ſaid peace, by the which all treſpaſſes on either ſide were remitted, and contrary to the Cuſtoms aforeſaid; and if in caſe it were forfeited, yet he took ſuch a diſtreſs, 15 pounds of honey, and many horſes, and impriſoned his men; and this he took of the Princes own proper goods: And further, took booties of Bagiers which came to <hi>Lyrpool</hi> with Marchandize, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the ſame, until he had taken ſo much money for the ſame as it pleaſed him.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. When certain men of <hi>Geneurglyn</hi> had taken certain goods of ſome of their Neighbours of <hi>Geneurglyn,</hi> when they were in the Dominion of the Prince in <hi>Meyreon,</hi> the Kings men of <hi>Lhanbadarn</hi> did take away the ſaid goods out of the ſaid Dominion of the Prince; and when the Princes men came thither, and asked the cauſe why they took the ſaid prey, the Kings men killed one of them, and wounded others, and the reſt they did impriſon; neither could the Prince get any juſtice for the ſaid goods to this day.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And where it is contained in the peace, That all things committed in the Marches, ſhall be redreſſed in the Marches; yet the Kings men would no where hear the Princes men, but put them in the Caſtle of <hi>Lhanbadarn;</hi> which is againſt the peace aforeſaid. In theſe Articles and divers others the King ſtandeth ſworn to the Prince, and his people. And although the Prince as well by himſelf as by his people have often requeſted the King to cauſe the ſaid peace to be kept, yet was it in no point kept, but daily the Kings Juſtices did more and more heap injuries and griefs upon the people of thoſe parts: So that it cannot be blamed, if the Prince did aſſent to them that firſt began the wars, ſeeing the Oath which the Lord <hi>Robert Typtoft</hi> ſware unto the King, was kept in no point; and chiefly ſeeing the Prince was forewarned, that he ſhould be taken as ſoon as the King came to <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> as he had been indeed, if the King had come thither after Chriſtmas, as he purpoſed.</p>

                        <head>Theſe Griefs following were done by the King and his Officers, to the Lord <hi>David ap Gruffith.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. When the ſaid <hi>David</hi> came to the Lord <hi>Edward</hi> then Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and did him homage; the ſaid Lord <hi>Edw.</hi> did give by his Letters Patents to the ſaid <hi>David</hi> two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefs, <hi>Dyffryn Cluyd</hi> and <hi>Crinmeyrch</hi> with all the appurtenances: afterwards when he was made King, he confirmed the ſaid gift to the ſaid <hi>David,</hi> and gave him poſſeſſion of them; After, when <hi>Gwenlhian Lacy</hi> died, who held ſome Towns in the ſaid Cantrefs for term of life, which after her deceaſe appertained to <hi>David</hi> by force of the aforeſaid grant; which Towns yet the King took from him, contrary to his Letters Patents.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Item,</hi> When the ſaid <hi>David</hi> did hold of the Lord the King the Villages of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Eſton</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> of the which he ought to anſwer no man, but according to the Laws of <hi>Wales;</hi> yet the Juſtice of <hi>Chester</hi> cauſed the ſaid <hi>David</hi> to be called to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> at the ſuite
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61256:185"/> of one <hi>William Venable</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> to anſwer for the Title of the ſaid Villages; and although the ſaid <hi>David</hi> did often and inſtantly deſire him the ſaid juſtice, not to proceed againſt him injuriouſly in the County of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> where he was not bound to anſwer by the form of the peace; yet he plainly denied him to be judged, either in <hi>Wales,</hi> or after the Laws of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Item,</hi> The ſaid Juſtice of <hi>Chester,</hi> to the injury of the ſaid <hi>David,</hi> did cut down his Wood of <hi>Lhyweny,</hi> and his Woods at <hi>Hope,</hi> as well by the Dwellers of <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and yet the ſaid Juſtice had no juriſdiction in thoſe patts; and not being conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to get Timber there for building, as well of <hi>Ruthlan</hi> as of other places, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ſame Woods, ſold it and carried it into <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. This is the Form of peace which the King of <hi>England</hi> did promiſe the men of <hi>Ros</hi> before they did him homage, which he promiſed them to obſerve inviolably. That is to ſay, That the King ſhould grant to every of them their Right and Juriſdiction, as they had in time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> according as the ſaid men do report that they had in the time of King <hi>Henry.</hi>

                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. A Tenant of <hi>Grono ap Heilyn</hi> was called to the Kings Court without any cauſe. Then <hi>Grono</hi> came at the day appointed to defend his Tenant, and demanded juſtice for him, or the Law which the men of his Countrey did uſe: All this being denied, the ſaid Tenant was condemned in 27 l. 1 d. ob. which cauſed the ſaid <hi>Grono</hi> to go to <hi>London</hi> for juſtice; which was promiſed him, but he could never have any, where he ſpent in his journy 15 marks.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A certain Gentleman was ſlain, who had foſtered the ſon of <hi>Grono ap Heilyn;</hi> and he that killed him was taken, and brought to <hi>Ruthlan</hi> Caſtle; then the ſaid <hi>Grono,</hi> and the kindred of him that was ſlain asked juſtice, but ſome of them were impriſoned, and the Killer diſcharged: Then <hi>Grono</hi> went again to <hi>London</hi> for juſtice, which the King did promiſe him, but he never had any, but ſpent 20 Marks.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third time <hi>Grono</hi> was fain to go to <hi>London</hi> for juſtice, in the premiſes, where he ſpent 18 Marks 6 s. 6 d. And then likewiſe the King promiſed him that he ſhould have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but when he certainly believed to have juſtice, <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſaid openly, that he had all doings in that Countrey by the Kings Charters, and took away all the Baliwikes which the King had given to the ſaid <hi>Grono,</hi> and ſold them at his pleaſure: Then the ſaid <hi>Grono</hi> asked juſtice of the ſaid <hi>Reginald,</hi> but he could not be heard.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The ſaid <hi>Grono</hi> took to Farm for 4 years of <hi>Godfrey, Marliney, Maynan</hi> and <hi>Lhyffayn;</hi> then <hi>Robert Cruquer</hi> came with his Horſes and Armes, to get the ſaid land by force; and for that, <hi>Grono</hi> would not ſuffer him to have the ſaid lands before his years were out, he was called to the Law, and then the ſaid <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> came with 24 Horſes to take the ſaid <hi>Grono:</hi> And for that, that day they could not have their purpoſe, they called <hi>Grono</hi> the next day to <hi>Ruthlan;</hi> and then <hi>Grono</hi> had councel not to go to <hi>Ruthlan:</hi> Then they called him again, to anſwer at <hi>Caerwys;</hi> but the ſaid <hi>Grono</hi> durſt not go thither, but by the conduct of the Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> for that <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> was there, and his men in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. For theſe griefs, for the which he could get no juſtice, but labour and expences of 54 Marks, and more; and for that he durſt not in his own perſon go to the Court, he ſent Letters, one to the King, another to his brother <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> to ſignifie to the King that he ſhould loſe all the favour of the Countrey, if he kept no promiſe with them; and ſo it came to paſs, becauſe the men of <hi>Ros</hi> and <hi>Englefield</hi> could get no juſtice, the King negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the correction of theſe things, loſt the whole Countrey.</p>

                        <head>Humbly ſheweth to your Holineſs Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of <hi>England,</hi> the Noblemen of <hi>Tegengl.</hi> That when the ſaid Noblemen did their Homage to the Lord <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> the ſaid King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to defend them and their Goods, and that they ſhould uſe all kind of Right, Priviledge and Juriſdiction, which they did uſe in the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> by the Grant of the ſaid King, whereof they were after ſpoiled.</head>
                        <p>Firſt they were ſpoiled of their Right, and Priviledges, and Cuſtoms of the Countrey, and were compelled to be judged by the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> whereas the Tenure of that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61256:187"/> their priviledge was to be judged according to the Laws of <hi>Wales</hi> at <hi>Tref Edwyn,</hi> at <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> and at <hi>Caerwys,</hi> and the beſt men of the Countrey were taken, becauſe they deſired to be judged at <hi>Tref Edwyn,</hi> according to the Tenure of their priviledges, by the Laws of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whatſoever one Juſtice doth, his ſucceſſor doth reverſe the ſame; for in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> revoked that which his predeceſſor confirmed and allowed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If he do take any Gentleman of that Countrey, he will not let him go upon ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he ought to do.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If any Gentleman be brought to the Caſtle of <hi>Flint,</hi> upon a ſmall accuſation, and his cattel withal, they can neither be delivered or have delay, until they give the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Oxe, and until they pay 3 l. fees to <hi>Cynwrick,</hi> for having of the delay.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> gave the lands of the men of <hi>Merton</hi> to the Abbot and Covent of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingwerk,</hi> againſt the Laws of <hi>Wales</hi> and Cuſtom of the Countrey, and contrary to the Form of peace betwixt <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> and the King; that is to ſay, 16 <hi>Caratatas terrae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Noble and Beſt of the Countrey be injured, for that the King builded the Caſtle of <hi>Flint</hi> upon their ground, and the King commanded the Juſtices to give the men as much good ground, or the price; but they are ſpoiled of their lands, and have neither other lands nor their money.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> will not ſuffer men to cut their own Wood, until he have both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and reward, and until they pay for it alſo; but permitteth others to cut it down freely, which they ought not to do by the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. When the men of <hi>Cyrchynan</hi> Covenant with the King, to give the King half a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, upon condition the King ſhould not ſuffer the Woods to be cut down, <hi>Howel ap Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith</hi> being preſent; yet <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> hath broken the ſame, permitting every man to cut their Woods, and ſpoil them alſo of their Meadow.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The ſame <hi>Cynwric ap Grono</hi> was taken at <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> and put in priſon without any cauſe at all, neither would the Kings Officers deliver him, unleſs he would redeem the gage of a certain woman; for the which he was conſtrained to pay much more than the pawn lay for.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. When the Bailiff of <hi>Ruthlan</hi> was at a Feaſt, <hi>Hicken Lemaile</hi> wounded a Gentleman cruelly in the preſence of the ſaid Bailiff; by occaſion of which wound, <hi>Hicken</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in 8 l. and when he which was hurt would have demanded the 8 l. he was put in priſon by <hi>Hicken.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. The meſſengers of <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> attempted an abſurdity not heard of, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the people of the Countrey to plough his ground, and ſowe the ſame; and the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were <hi>Cynwric Says,</hi> and <hi>Hicken Lemayl;</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Cynwric</hi> ſwore openly before the whole company, that unleſs all men ſhould plough <hi>Reginald Greys</hi> ground, they ſhould ſhortly repent it; then the people feared much, as in that caſe any conſtant man would fear.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. The heirs of <hi>Tegengl</hi> bought their Offices for 30 Marks of the King; but afterward <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> ſpoiled them of their Offices and money, contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. Seven Gentlemen were wrongfully killed by the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> but as yet the Parents of the Gentlemen can have no amends, and though the offenders were taken, yet the ſaid Conſtable let them go without puniſhment.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. The Conſtable of <hi>Ruthlan</hi> kept two of the Kings ſouldiers in priſon, for that they took an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> who had wounded a man.</p>
                        <p>All theſe things contained in theſe Articles are contrary to the priviledge, liberty and right of the ſaid men, and contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>Wales;</hi> neither dare the Inhabitants ſend their Complaints to the King, for fear of <hi>Reginald Grey</hi> (which fear any conſtant man might have) becauſe the ſaid <hi>Reginald</hi> ſaid openly, that if he could come by any ſuch their meſſengers, he would cut off their heads, as it is certainly told us by one of his Councel; further, neither tongue can tell, nor pen write, how cruelly the men of <hi>Tegengl</hi> have been ordered.</p>
                        <p>Humbly complaineth to your Lordſhip my Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate of all <hi>England, Lhewelyn ap Gruffith ap Madoc,</hi> of the Conſtable of <hi>Oſwalds</hi> Croſs, the King and of the men of that Town, who have ſpoiled the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> of the third part of a Town called <hi>Lhedrot,</hi> and his fathers houſe, without any Law, or Right, or Cuſtom of the Countrey. Further, the ſaid Conſtable and his Complices have againſt the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Countrey, ſpoiled the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> of his Common and Paſture, which he and his predeceſſors have uſed time out of mind, and further condemned the ſaid <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welyn</hi> for the ſaid Paſture in 70 Marks: And further the King of <hi>England</hi> granted certain Letters to a Baſtard called <hi>Gruffith Vachan</hi> of <hi>Cynlhaeth,</hi> to law with the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> for his whole Lordſhip and poſſeſſions; by the occaſion of the which Letters, the ſaid <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welyn</hi> hath ſpent 200 l. of good money.</p>
                        <p>Alſo the ſaid Conſtable compelled the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> to ſend two Gentlemen to him; whom when they came to him, he cauſed to be hanged; which Gentlemen ought not by
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61256:187"/> right to have been hanged, whoſe parents had rather have given him 300l.</p>
                        <p>Afterward the ſaid Conſtable impriſoned 60. of the Men of the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> (no cauſe alledged) but that a certain Page ſpake a word, who could not be delivered out of priſon untill every one of them paid 10 s.</p>
                        <p>When the Men of the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> came to the ſaid Town to ſell their Oxen, the ſaid Conſtable would cauſe the beaſt to be driven to the Caſtle; neither would he reſtore the beaſts, nor mony for them. Further the ſaid Conſtable and his men took away the Cattle of the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> from his own ground, and did their will with them.</p>
                        <p>Further the Kings Juſtices compelled the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> contrary to the law and cuſtome of <hi>Wales,</hi> to deliver to the Sons of <hi>Eneon ap Gruffith,</hi> a certain Town which both he and his Anceſtors ever had held. The ſaid Conſtable took the horſe of <hi>Lhewelyns</hi> Baliffe, when the ſaid Baliffe owed him nothing, who could never get his horſe again, nor any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for it.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore when the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> ſhould have gone to a Town called <hi>Caerlheon</hi> to appear there, as he was appointed, the Sons of <hi>Gruffith ap Gwenwynwyn</hi> and the Soldiers of <hi>Robert Strange</hi> by the Councel of the ſaid <hi>Roger,</hi> took the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> and his Men, and impriſoned them, to their great damage, which the ſaid <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> would not for 300 l. ſtarling, who could by no means be delivered untill they had found ſufficient ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p>The Archbiſhop receiving theſe and other Articles, came to the King, and requeſted him to conſider theſe wrongs, and to cauſe amends to be made, or at the leaſt excuſe the <hi>Welſhmen,</hi> having ſo juſt cauſe of grief; who anſwered that the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, yet he ſaid he was ever ready to do Juſtice to all them that complained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Archbiſhop beſought the King again, that the Welſhmen might have free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his Grace, to declare their griefs, and to ſeek remedy; the King anſwered they ſhould freely come and depart, if it ſhould ſeem that by Juſtice they deſerved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
                        <p>The Archbiſhop hearing this, went and came to the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> in <hi>Snowdon,</hi> that he might move him and his Brother <hi>David,</hi> and the other company to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereby he might incline the King to admit them; to which after much talke and conference with the Archbiſhop, the Prince anſwered, that he was ready to ſubmit to the King; reſerving two things, that is to ſay his conſcience, which he ought to have for the rule and ſafe-guard of his people, and alſo the decency of his State and calling; which anſwer the Archbiſhop brought and reported to the King. At the which the King ſaid, that he would not any other treaty of peace then that the Prince and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould ſimply ſubmit themſelves. But the Archbiſhop (knowing well that the <hi>Welſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> would not ſubmit themſelves but in form aforeſaid, or in other form to them tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of them liked, requeſted the King that he might have conference in this matter with all the Noble <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> then preſent, who after much conference agreed to all theſe Articles following. The which Articles the Archbiſhop did ſend in writing to the Prince by <hi>John Wallenſis.</hi>

                        <p>Firſt, though the Lord, the King will have no treaty of the four Cantreds, the Lands that he gave to his Nobles,<note place="margin">The right of lands derived from <hi>Camber.</hi>
                           </note> nor the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> yet the Princes Councel will no peace be made unleſs treaty be had of them, For that the four Cantreds be of the mere Tenure of the Prince, whereas the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> had more right, ſince the time of <hi>Camber</hi> Son of <hi>Brute,</hi> ſo that they be of the principality of <hi>VVales.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the which the Prince obtained by <hi>Otobanus,</hi> the Popes Legate in <hi>England,</hi> by the conſent of the King and his Father. As it doth appear by the Letters Patentes.

                           </note> and uſed ſervice, then the ſame to be given to ſtrangers, which abuſe the people by force and power.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All the Tenents of all the Cantreds of <hi>VVales</hi> altogether do ſay, that they dare not ſubmit themſelves to the King, to do his pleaſure, firſt for that the King kept neither co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant nor oath, nor grant by charter from the beginning, to the Prince or his people. Secondly that the Kings men do cruelly exerciſe Tyranny towards the Church and Churchmen. Thirdly that they be not bound to any ſuch matter, ſeeing they be the Princes Tenants, who is ready to do, uſed and accuſtomed ſervice, and to obey the King with and by the ſaid ſervice,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To that which is ſaid that the Prince ſhould ſimply commit himſelf to the Kings will it is anſwered, that none of us will dare come to the King for the cauſe aforeſaid; we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together will not ſuffer our Prince to come in that manner.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Item,</hi> where the great Men of <hi>England</hi> would procure a proviſion of a 1000l. <hi>per annum</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> let it be anſwered, that ſuch proviſion is not to be accepted, for it that is procured by them, who go about to diſinherit the Prince to have his Lands in <hi>VVales.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Item,</hi> The Prince ought not to diſmiſs his inheritance, which his predeceſſours held
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61256:188"/> in <hi>VVales</hi> ſince the time of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and confirmed by the See Apoſtolick, and to take lands in <hi>England,</hi> where he knoweth neither tongue, manners, lawes nor cuſtomes, wherein he ſhall be ſoon entrapped, by his neighbours the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> his old malicious enemies, whereby he ſhould loſe land alſo.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Item,</hi> Seeing the King goeth about to deprive him of his ancient inheritance, it is not like that he would ſuffer him to poſſeſſe Lands in <hi>England,</hi> where he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no right; ſeeing that the Princes Lands in <hi>VVales,</hi> of his own inheritance, is but barren and untilled, it is leſſe like the King would ſuffer him to enjoy good fertile land in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Item,</hi> The Prince ſhould give the King poſſeſſion of <hi>Snowdon</hi> for ever. Let it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that ſeeing that <hi>Snowdon</hi> is of the appurtenances of the principality of <hi>VVales,</hi> which the Prince and his predeceſſours, hold ſince the time of <hi>Brute;</hi> His Councell will not ſuffer him to renounce that place, and to take a place in <hi>England</hi> leſſe due unto him.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Item,</hi> The people of <hi>Snowdon</hi> do ſay, that although the prince would give the King poſſeſſion of it, yet they would never do homage to ſtrangers, of whoſe tongue, Manners, Lawes, they ſhould be ignorant; for ſo they ſhould be for ever Captives, and as cruelly handled as the Cantreds have been by the Kings Bayliffs, and other the Kings men, handled more cruelly then <hi>Saracens,</hi> as it doth well appear by the notes of their griefs which the men of the Cantreds ſent to you holy Father.</p>

                        <head>Theſe are to be Anſwered; For <hi>David</hi> the Kings Brother.</head>
                        <p>When he is diſpoſed to ſee the Holy Land, will do it for Gods ſake voluntarily, not by ſuch inforcement againſt his will; for he intendeth not to go on pilgrimage in that ſort, becauſe he knoweth enforced ſervice not to pleaſe God; and if he hereafter ſhall for devotion ſee the holy land, that it is no cauſe for ever to diſinherit his Ofspring, but rather to reward them.</p>
                        <p>And for that neither the Prince nor his people, for County nor for gains do move war, invading no mans lands, but defending their own Lands, Lawes and Liberties; and that the King and his people of inveterated hatred, and for covetuouſneſſe to get our Lands, invading the ſame moved war: We therefore ſee our defence is juſt and lawful; and herein we truſt God will help us, and will turne his revenge upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of Churches, who have rooted up, and burned Churches, and taken out, both all ſacraments and ſacred things from them, killing Prieſts, Clerks, Religious, Lame, Dumb, Deaf, Younglings, Sucklings at their mothers paps, Weak and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, both man and woman, and committing all other enormities, as partly it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to your Holineſſe. Wherefore God forbid that your Holineſſe ſhould fulminate ſentence againſt any, but ſuch as have done ſuch things; we who have ſuffered all thoſe things at the Kings Officers hands, do hope at your hands remedy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and that you, will puniſh ſuch Church Robbers and killers, who can defend themſelves no wayes, leaſt their impunity be cauſe and example for others to do the like. Very many in our Country do much marvel, that you councelled us to leave our own land, and to go to another mans Lands, to live among our Enemies; for ſeeing we cannot have peace in our own Land, which is our own right, much leſſe ſhould we be quiet in an other mans amongſt our enemies; and though it be hard to live in warr and peril, harder it is to be utterly deſtroyed and brought to nothing, eſpecially for Chriſtians ſeeking nothing elſe but to defend our own, being by neceſſity dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereunto and the greedy ambition of our enemies.</p>
                        <p>And your Holineſſe told us that you had fulminated ſentence againſt all that for hatred or gaines do hinder the peace; and it appeareth evidently who do war for thoſe cauſes, the fear of death, the fear of impriſonment, the fear of perpetual priſon, the fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting, no keeping of promiſe, Covenant, Grant or Charter, tyrannical Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many more like, compell us to be in war; and this we ſhew to God, and to your Lordſhip, deſiring your godly and charitable help.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore if any in <hi>England</hi> have offended the King (as many do offend him) yet none of them be diſ-inherited; ſo if any of us have offended the King, let him be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and make ſatisfaction as he may, without exhereditating. As we truſt in you, we pray you holy father to labour to this end; if they lay to us that we break the peace, it appeareth evidently, that they (and not we) brake the ſame, who never kept promiſe nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, nor Order, made any amends for Treſpaſſes nor Remedy for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
                        <p>When the Archbiſhop could not conclude a peace, he denounced the Prince and his Complices accurſed; then the King ſent his army by ſea, to the Iſle of <hi>Môn</hi> or <hi>Angleſey,</hi> which they wan, and ſlew ſuch as reſiſted them; for the chiefeſt men ſerved the King,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:61256:189"/> as their oath was; ſo they came over againſt <hi>Bangor,</hi> where the arm of the ſea called <hi>Mê<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath,</hi>

This bridge was accompliſhed ſo that three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore men might well paſſe over in a front. <hi>VVilliam Latimer</hi> with a great number of the beſt Souldies, and <hi>Lucas Thany</hi> Steward of <hi>Gaſcoine</hi> with his <hi>Gaſcoynes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a great number were come to ſerve the King) paſſed over the bridge, and there ſaw no appearance of enemies; but as ſoon as the ſea began to flow, down came the <hi>VVelſhmen</hi> from the hills, and ſet upon them fiercely, and either ſlew or chaſed them to the ſea, to drown themſelves; for the water was ſo high, that they could not attain the bridge, ſaving <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Latimer</hi> alone whoſe horſe carried him to the bridge, and ſo he eſcaped.</p>
                        <p>There were ſlain and drowned at this time many worthy Souldiers, and amongſt others that famous Knight Sr. <hi>Lucas Thany, Robert Clifford,</hi> Sr. <hi>VVilliam Lindſey,</hi> and two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of good accompt, that were brethren to <hi>Robert Burnel</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Bath.</hi> There periſhed in all thirteen Knights,<note place="margin">

                        <p>In the mean time was the E. of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and Sr. <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> with an army in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales,</hi> where were many that ſerved the King, and there ſought with the Princes friends at <hi>Lhandeilo Vawr,</hi> and gave them an overthrow, wherein on the Kings ſide young <hi>William de Valence</hi> his coſen germane, &amp; four Knights more were ſlain. All this while the Prince deſtroyed the country of <hi>Caerdigan</hi> and all the lands of <hi>Rees ap Meredyth,</hi> who ſerved the King in all thoſe wars. But afterward the Prince ſeparated himſelf from his army with a few, and came to <hi>Buelht,</hi> thinking to remain their quietly for a while; and by chance, as he came by the water <hi>Wy,</hi> there were <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> and <hi>John Gifford</hi> with a great number of Soldiers, and either party were abaſhed of other, <hi>Edmund Mortimers</hi> men were of that Country, for his father was Lord thereof. Then the Prince departed from his men, and went to the valley with his Eſquire alone, to talk with certain Lords of the Country who had promiſed to meet him there.</p>
                        <p>Then ſome of his men ſeeing the enemy come down from the hill, kept the bridge called <hi>Pont Orewyn,</hi> and defended the paſſage manfully, till one declared to the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> where a ford was a little below, through the which they ſent a number of their men with <hi>Helias VValwyn,</hi> who ſuddainly fell upon them that defended the bridge, in their backs, and put them to flight. The Princes Eſquire told the Prince (as he ſtood ſecretly expecting the comming of ſuch as promiſed to meet him in a little grove) that he heard a great noiſe &amp; cry at the bridge.<note place="margin">P. <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> ſlain, &amp; with him the glory of <hi>Wales.</hi>
                           </note> And the prince asked whether his men had taken the bridge, and he ſaid, Yes; then ſaid the prince, I paſſe not, if all the power of <hi>England</hi> were upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. But ſuddainly behold the horſemen about the Grove; and as he would have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped unto his men, they purſued him ſo hard, that one <hi>Adam Francton</hi> ran him through with a ſtaff being unarmed, and knew him not; and his men being but a few, ſtood and fought boldly, ever looking for their prince, till the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> by force of Archers mixt with the horſemen wan the hill, and put them to flight, and as they returned, <hi>Francton</hi> went to ſpoyle him whom he had ſlain, and when he ſaw his face he knew him very well, and ſtruck off his head, and ſent it to the King at the Abbey of <hi>Conwey,</hi> who received it with great joy, cauſed it to be ſet upon one of the higheſt Turrets of the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>

And when they were come, he deferred the conſultation till he was certified that the Queen was delivered of a ſon, then ſending certain Lords to the Chriſtening of his child and informing them how he would have him named, he called the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> together, declaring unto them, that whereas they were oftentimes ſuiters unto him to appoint them a Prince, he now having occaſion to depart out of the Country, would name them a prince if they would allow and obey him, whom he ſhould name. To the which motion they anſwered that they would ſo do, if he would appoint one of their own Nation to be their prince, whereunto the King replyed, that he would name one that was born in <hi>Wales,</hi> and could ſpeak never a word of Engliſh, whoſe life and converſation no man was able to ſtain, and when they all had granted that ſuch an one they would obey, he named his own ſon <hi>Edward</hi> born at <hi>Caernarvon</hi> Caſtle a few dayes before.</p>
                        <p>Then the King having the whole country at his will, gave whole Towns and Lordſhips in the midſt of <hi>Wales</hi> unto Engliſh Lords, as the Lordſhip of <hi>Denbigh</hi> to <hi>Henry Lacy</hi> Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Lordſhip of <hi>Ruthin</hi> to the Lord <hi>Reginald Grey,</hi> ſecond ſon to <hi>J.

                        <p>After this the King builded a ſtrong Caſtle within the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> and called the ſame <hi>Beaumariſh,</hi> and ſo ſetting all in quietneſs, and puniſhing ſuch as had put to death <hi>Roger de Pueleſdon,</hi> he returned home with his army;<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>This limitation of Eſtate of this principality unto the prince and his heirs Kings of <hi>England,</hi> may ſeem ſtrange to our Modern Lawyers. For how is it poſſible that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> can inherit the principality, ſince the principality being the leſſer dignity is extinguiſhed in the Kingly Eſtate, being the greater; for <hi>in preſentia majoris ceſſat id quod minus est,</hi> for as much as the Heir apparent of the crown (being Prince) is preſently upon the death of his Anceſtor <hi>eo inſtante</hi> King himſelf, and the principality as the leſſer not compatible with the Kingdom, being the greater.</p>
                        <p>But when I conſider that this age where in this Charter was penned, was a learned age of Judges and Lawyers (by whoſe advice no doubt in a matter of this importance this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was penned) and this age much commended for exquiſite knowledg of the lawes, by thoſe learned Men that lived in the ſucceeding times, I cannot but think reverently of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, although I cannot yield ſufficient reaſon of their doings therein. Nevertheleſs for as much as all the Charters in the ages following made to the Prince, do hold the ſame manner of limitation of Eſtate,<note place="margin">Sr. <hi>John Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge</hi> his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</note> I am perſwaded ſome myſtery of good policy lies hid therein, which as I conceive may be this, or ſuch like. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> thought to confer upon the Prince and heir apparent, an Eſtate in Fee ſimple in the lands that they beſtowed upon him; for a leſſer than an Inheritance had not been anſwerable to ſo great a dignity. And yet they were not willing to give him any larger Eſtate then ſuch as ſhould extinguiſh again in the Crown when he came to be King or died, for that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King ſhould alſo have the like power to create the Prince or his heir apparent, and to inveſt him into that dignity, as he, being the Father, was inveſted by his Progenitor. For the wiſdom of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> was ſuch, as that they would not deprive themſelves of that honour, but that every of them might make new Creations and Inveſtitures of the principality to ther Eldeſt Son, and next ſucceeding heir apparent, and that thoſe lands ſo given unto the Prince, might when he was King be annexed, knit and united again to the crown, and out of the crown to be anew conferred, which could not ſo have been if thoſe lands had been given to the Prince and his heirs generall, for then the lands ſo given would have reſted in the natural perſon of the Princes after they came to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diſtinct from the Crown, Lands; and might as the caſe ſhould happen, deſcend to others then thoſe which were his heirs apparent to the Crown. And herein I do obſerve a difference between the principality of <hi>Wales</hi> given to the Prince, and the Dutchy of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi>
                           <pb n="334" facs="tcp:61256:198"/> given unto him. For every Prince needeth, and ſo hath had a new creation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture. But he is Duke of <hi>Cornewal</hi> as ſoon as he is born, if his Anceſtor be then King of <hi>England;</hi> and if not, he is Duke of <hi>Cornwall eo inſtante</hi> that his father is King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſaid King alſo by an another charter, dated the 20 of <hi>September</hi> in the ſaid 17. year of his reign, granted unto the ſaid prince all arrerages of rents, duties, accompts; Stocks, ſtores, goods and chattels remaining in all and every the ſaid parts due, or by right belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the King, and thereupon the prince accordingly was poſſeſſed by vertue of theſe charters of all theſe aforeſaid.</p>
